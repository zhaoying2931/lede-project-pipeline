BLACK HILLS ENERGY (BHE) HAS A 6-INCH STEEL DISTRIBUTION MAIN ATTACHED AND SUPPORTED UNDER THE BRIDGE.   K2 CONSTRUCTION HAD AN 811 LOCATE TICKET TO DO EXCAVATE AT THIS LOCATION.  THIS MAIN WAS ACCURATELY LOCATED BY BHE PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT.  THE MAIN TRANSITIONED FROM THE BRIDGE TO GO UNDERGROUND ON THE NORTH SIDE WHERE IT WAS HIT.  PRIOR TO INCIDENT, BHE WAS PREPARING TO INSTALL STOPPLE FITTINGS AND VALVES ON THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDE OF THIS BRIDGE CROSSING.  THE INTENT WAS TO BE ABLE TO ISOLATE THE SECTION OF MAIN ON THE BRIDGE TO ALLOW A QUICK AND SAFE WAY TO STOP GAS FLOW IF ANY DAMAGE OCCURRED DURING BRIDGE REPAIR.  K2 CONSTRUCTION WAS AWARE OF THE GAS MAIN ON THE NORTH SIDE AND BHE'S EFFORT TO INSTALL VALVES DID NOT WAIT FOR BHE TO FINISH INSTALLATION.  ON SATURDAY MAY 22ND, K2 CONSTRUCTION CONTINUED WITH THIS PROJECT AND DUG IN THE TOLERANCE ZONE WITH AN EXCAVATOR DIRECTLY OVER THE PIPELINE.  THIS PUNCTURED THE 6-INCH MAIN CAUSING A 1.5-INCH BY 3-INCH HOLE ALLOWING BLOWING NATURAL GAS TO ESCAPE TO ATMOSPHERE.  911 WAS CALLED BY THE EXCAVATOR AND LINCOLN POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME ON SCENE TO CONTROL TRAFFIC AND OFFER SUPPORT FOR BHE THROUGHOUT THE INCIDENT. BHE ARRIVED WITH PERSONNEL TO SAFELY MONITOR, CONTROL THE BLOWING GAS, AND MAKE REPAIRS.  A NEBRASKA STATE FIRE MARSHAL DEPUTY INSPECTOR ALSO RESPONDED TO THIS INCIDENT TO MONITOR AND INVESTIGATE.  STOPPLE FITTINGS WERE WELDED ON THE SOUTH AND NORTH SIDE OF THE BRIDGE TO STOP FLOW OF GAS.  A BYPASS WAS INSTALLED TO MAINTAIN GAS SUPPLY TO A LARGE RESIDENTIAL AREA NORTH OF THE BRIDGE.  ONCE THE BYPASS WAS COMPLETED, THE STOPPLES WERE INSERTED TO STOP THE BLOWING GAS.  GAS BLEW FOR APPROXIMATELY 14 HOURS AND THE AREA WAS MONITORED BY BHE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL THROUGHOUT THE INCIDENT UNTIL REPAIRS COULD BE MADE. THE DAMAGED SECTION OF MAIN WAS REPLACED, PIPELINE RE-PRESSURED AND BYPASS REMOVED.   POOR EXCAVATION PRACTICES RESULTED IN THE INCIDENT."

THE DISTRIBUTION CREW EXPOSED THE TAPPING TEE TO THE SERVICE AND CUT OFF THE SERVICE. THIS OCCURRED AT 5:21AM. NSG COMPLETED A LEAK SURVEY AT THE LOCATION ALONG WITH ODORANT READS NEXT DOOR. THE LEAK SURVEY INDICATED A PRESENCE OF GAS NEAR THE RISER. THE RESULT OF THE ODORANT READS WERE WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE RANGE.    AT 2:14PM ON APRIL 14, 2021 THE FIRE DEPARTMENT INFORMED NSG REPRESENTATIVES THAT JURISDICTIONAL GAS MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE. THEREFORE, A REPORT WAS FILED WITH THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC).  THE REPORT NUMBER IS 1302677.    ON APRIL 15, 2021, THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION (ICC) ARRIVED TO THE SCENE TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION. THE ICC REQUESTED THAT NSG CONDUCT A PRESSURE TEST OF THE SERVICE TO THE HOUSE.

THE ICC ALSO REQUESTED THAT THE HOUSE PIPING BE PRESSURE TESTED. THE PRESSURE TEST FOR THE 1ST FLOOR APARTMENT PASSED THE PRESSURE TEST, HOWEVER, THE 2ND FLOOR APARTMENT FAILED.     AN INSPECTION OF THE ANODELESS RISER FROM THE SCENE WILL TAKE PLACE ON MAY 20, 2021.    NSG HAD REQUESTED VIDEO FOOTAGE FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT VIA THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA). THIS REQUEST WAS DENIED SINCE THERE IS AN ACTIVE POLICE INVESTIGATION RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT.    AT THIS TIME THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS NOT KNOWN AND IS UNDER AN ACTIVE POLICE INVESTIGATION."

BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THE CORROSION FOUND ON FEBRUARY 23, 2021, MDU CORROSION CONTROL PERSONNEL STARTED INVESTIGATING THE CONDITION OF THE HINSDALE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ON MARCH 1, 2021. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION THAT CONCLUDED ON MARCH 3, 2021, AN EXPANDED INVESTIGATION WAS STARTED ON MARCH 9, 2021. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND INVESTIGATION, MDU CONDUCTED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE HINSDALE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ON MARCH 17 AND 18, 2021. THE LEAK SURVEY IDENTIFIED APPROXIMATELY 40 UNDERGROUND LEAKS OF WHICH 12 WERE GRADE 1. AS GRADE 1 LEAKS WERE IDENTIFIED, MDU CREWS WERE ON SITE TO ESTABLISH SAFETY PERIMETERS, EXCAVATE, AND MAKE TEMPORARY REPAIRS.     ON MARCH 19, 2021 AT 5:20 P.M.

WHILE DISTRIBUTION EMPLOYEES WERE ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING THE LEAK, GSW'S WERE MONITORING THE NEARBY HOMES AND SEWERS. DURING THE INVESTIGATION, GAS READS WERE DISCOVERED IN THE SEWER. GAS SERVICE EMPLOYEES REMAIN ONSITE AND CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED THE HOMES, SEWERS AND THE SURROUNDING AREA.    ON FEBRUARY 19, 2021, AN ADDITIONAL LEAK WAS DISCOVERED APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET FROM THE SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT AT 518 HIGH STREET.   THE LEAK WAS LOCATED ON THE 2-INCH STEEL MEDIUM PRESSURE PIPELINE.  THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE A CORROSION AND WAS LOCATED AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION. A PLIDCO FITTING WAS INSTALLED AS A TEMPORARY REPAIR.    FOLLOWING REPAIRS OF ALL IDENTIFIED LEAKS, THE NATURAL GAS ODOR REMAINED PERCEPTIBLE, AND READINGS WERE PRESENT NEAR THE REPAIR LOCATION. THE VAPOR EXTRACTION UNIT (VEU) WAS USED TO EXTRACTED NATURAL GAS SATURATED SOIL AND PERSONNEL REMAINED ONSITE AND CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED UNTIL GAS READS MET CLASSIFIABLE CRITERIA.     OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS, DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PERSONNEL CONTINUED TO EXTRACT GAS FROM THE SOIL AND INVESTIGATE FOR ADDITIONAL LEAKS.  SEVERAL ADDITIONAL LEAKS AT THE SERVICE CONNECTIONS WERE IDENTIFIED AT 515 HIGH STREET, 528 HIGH STREET AND 529 HIGH STREET.     BASED ON THE AGE AND CONDITION OF THE PIPELINE, OPERATIONS CONSULTED WITH ENGINEERING AND A DECISION WAS MADE TO REPLACE THE 1928 VINTAGE STEEL PIPELINE AND SERVICES.    A PIPELINE REPLACEMENT PROJECT BEGAN ON FEBRUARY 23 - MARCH 4.  APPROXIMATELY 600 FEET OF 2-INCH PLASTIC, MEDIUM PRESSURE PIPELINE WAS DIRECTIONAL DRILLED, AND 9 SERVICE RENEWALS COMPLETED."

ON DECEMBER 23, 2020 THERE WAS A COMBINED INVESTIGATION WITH SEVERAL PARTIES OF INTEREST TO TRY AND LOCATE THE ORIGIN AND CAUSE OF THE LOSS. DURING THIS COMBINED INVESTIGATION, THE GAS SERVICE TO 4810 S 51ST STREET WAS PRESSURE TESTED. THE RESULTS OF THIS PRESSURE TEST REVEALED NO ISSUES OR LEAKS WITH THE GAS SERVICE FROM THE GAS TRANSMISSION LINE TO THE HOUSE FOUNDATION. TO DATE, THE DISTRICTS INVESTIGATION REMAINS OPEN."

ATMOS ENERGY CREWS RESPONDED BY MAKING THE AREA SAFE, EVACUATING THE HIGH SCHOOL, AND THEN BEGAN THE PROCESS OF RESTORING SERVICE TO THE HIGH SCHOOL.  THE MAIN LINE IN THE AREA CONSISTED OF 4"" STEEL PIPE.  HOWEVER, THE REPAIR REQUIRED THE INSTALLATION OF A POLY TRANSITION FITTING FROM THE STEEL MAIN TO THE 3"" STEEL SERVICE LINE AS WELL AS THE INSTALLATION OF A POLY VALVE.  A BELL HOLE WAS DUG AT THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGE AND WHERE THE MAIN TO SERVICE LINE CONNECTION WAS BEING REPLACED. ON THE MORNING OF SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, REPAIRS HAD BEEN COMPLETED ON THE SEGMENT OF MAIN UP TO THE CLOSED POLY VALVE AND WAS ACTIVE WITH NATURAL GAS. ATMOS ENERGY EMPLOYEES WERE PREPARING TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL WORK THAT WAS REQUIRED FOR THE SERVICE LINE WHEN NATURAL GAS SUDDENLY ESCAPED AND IGNITED AT APPROXIMATELY 9:20 A.M.  TWO EMPLOYEES WERE INJURED AND WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.  ONE EMPLOYEE WAS TREATED AND RELEASED, AND THE OTHER WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL AT 11:17 AM.      THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE AND RELEASE OF THE 4"" ELECTROFUSION COUPLING THAT OCCURRED WITHIN THE NORTH BELL HOLE.  THE JOINT FAILURE WAS SUDDEN AND OCCURRED AFTER THE COUPLING WAS  INSTALLED AND PLACED IN SERVICE.  THE JOINT FAILURE AND SEPARATION OF THE COUPLING OCCURRED WITHIN THE SAME EXCAVATED BELL HOLE THAT THE RESULTING INJURED CREW MEMBERS WERE WORKING DOWNSTREAM PERFORMING FINAL SYSTEM TIE-INS.      THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF IGNITION OCCURRED FROM THE ENERGIZED FITTING BEING FUSED (4"" EF COUPLING) ON THE OUTLET SIDE OF THE VALVE. NONE OF THESE ACTIVITIES PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF A DIRECT CAUSE OF FAILURE.  SINCE THE MATERIALS INVOLVED IN THE FAILURE WERE DESTROYED IN THE RESULTING FIRE, LABORATORY TESTING CANNOT BE CONDUCTED ON THE FAILED FITTING TO FURTHER EVALUATE ROOT CAUSE.  HOWEVER, TESTING WAS CONDUCTED ON OTHER ELEMENTS IN INVESTIGATION OF THE ROOT CAUSE SUCH AS THE ELECTROFUSION PROCESSOR UNIT, THE DOWNSTREAM VALVE, AND PRIOR FUSIONS PERFORMED BY THE SAME QUALIFIED EMPLOYEE."

THE GAS FIRST RESPONSE (GFR) TECHNICIAN FIRST ARRIVED ONSITE AT 02:40 AND FOUND THAT A CONTRACTOR (SEFNCO) HAD DAMAGED THE 4"" PE GAS MAIN WHILE DIRECTIONAL DRILLING ACROSS MERIDIAN STREET TO INSTALL NEW TELECOMMUNICATION CABLE.     THE GFR TECHNICIAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND REQUESTED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD BLOCKED ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY ONE BLOCK RADIUS SURROUNDING THE DAMAGE. PSE'S ELECTRIC FIRST RESPONSE WAS CONTACTED TO DE-ENERGIZE CUSTOMERS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY AS A PRECAUTION.   IN ORDER TO ISOLATE AND SHUT DOWN THE GAS LEAK, A COMBINATION OF PIPE SQUEEZES AND VALVE CLOSURES WERE REQUIRED.  THE BREAK WAS JUST SOUTH OF A TWO-WAY CONNECTION TO A 2"" PE MAIN THAT RUNS PERPENDICULAR (EAST/WEST) TO THE 4"" PE MAIN.  VALVES ON THE 2"" MAIN, IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE DAMAGED 4"" MAIN, WERE NOTED BY GAS FIRST RESPONSE PERSONNEL AS REQUIRING EXCAVATION TO OPERATE.  BECAUSE OF THE GAS READS IN THE AREA, SQUEEZE LOCATIONS ON THE 2"" MAIN FURTHER FROM THE DAMAGED 4"" WERE SELECTED AS ALTERNATES TO EXCAVATING AND OPERATING THE VALVES.  SQUEEZING OF THE 4"" PE MAIN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE DAMAGE WAS NOT FEASIBLE AS THE DEPTH OF MAIN WAS DETERMINED TO BE 6 TO 7 FEET DEEP.  INSTEAD, MULTIPLE VALVE CLOSURES WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE ISOLATION PLAN.

SOUTHWEST GAS CREWS ARRIVED AT 09:35 PDT AND OBTAINED GAS READS OF 4 LEL BY THE RISER TO THE LAUNDRY FACILITY, TURNED OFF THE METER, CONFIRMED ZERO GAS READS INSIDE THE UNOCCUPIED BUILDING, AND CONDUCTED FURTHER LEAK INVESTIGATION.  AT 10:13 PDT, IGNITION OF FUGITIVE NATURAL GAS OCCURRED WITHIN THE DETACHED, UNOCCUPIED LAUNDRY FACILITY STRUCTURE RESULTING IN A FIRE AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.  POST IGNITION LEAK SURVEY RESULTS DISCOVERED INCREASING GAS READINGS AND LEAK SPREAD RESULTING IN AN EVACUATION OF 14 PEOPLE FROM SOME UNITS OF THE ADJACENT, SEPARATE APARTMENT BUILDING. A LEAK ON A PVC SERVICE LINE COUPLING CONNECTION FITTING WAS REVEALED DURING A LEAK TEST OF THE PVC SERVICE DURING A POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION. ADDITIONALLY, A LEAK TEST PERFORMED ON THE CUSTOMER'S HOUSELINE FAILED DURING THE POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION.     PART A4: BASED ON COMMUNICATIONS THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF NEVADA'S REGULATORY OPERATIONS STAFF HAD WITH THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION'S ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION DIVISION, ""LOCAL TIME AND DATE OF THE INCIDENT"" REFLECTS THE TIME SOUTHWEST GAS WAS NOTIFIED OF A LEAK ON THE PIPELINE.  AT THAT TIME, NO INCIDENT REPORTING CRITERIA WAS MET.     PART A6:  SOUTHWEST GAS NOTIFIED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) TELEPHONICALLY OF THE INCIDENT ON JUNE 24, 2020 AT 14:33 PDT.  THE NRC ISSUED REPORT NUMBER 1280311 FOR THE INCIDENT.  SOUTHWEST GAS PROVIDED A 48-HOUR UPDATE TELEPHONICALLY TO THE NRC ON JUNE 25, 2020 AT 15:28 PDT. THE NRC ISSUED REPORT NUMBER 1280402 FOR THE UPDATED REPORT.    SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:     CHANGED PART G TO UPDATE THE APPARENT CAUSE FROM PART G5 TO G8. THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION. CURRENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE CAUSE MAY BE G3, G4, OR G5.  THE SAMPLE HAS BEEN SENT TO A THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS TESTING LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS AND THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS WILL BE PROVIDED IN A SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE. THE LEAK WAS ORIGINALLY BELIEVED TO BE DUE TO A SOLVENT CEMENT JOINT, BUT A CRACK WAS FOUND WHEN ASSESSED IN SOUTHWEST GAS'S MATERIALS TESTING LABORATORY. THE CRACK APPEARS TO BE A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK IN THE PIPE NEAR THE LOCATION OF THE PIPE TO COUPLING JOINT.     SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE 2:    FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, THE SERVICE LINE WAS DISCONNECTED AT THE MAIN.  ON MARCH 30, 2021, THE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER WAS REPLACED.    PART C, 3 AND 4 - CHANGED THE PIPE SIZE AND WALL THICKNESS TO 0.5-INCH AND 0.109-INCH RESPECTIVELY BASED ON 3RD PARTY LABORATORY ANALYSIS.    CHANGED PART G FROM G8 - OTHER INCIDENT CAUSE TO G4 - OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE, WITH A SUB-CAUSE AS OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE.  AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY'S MATERIAL INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS SUSTAINED EXTERNAL BENDING LOADS LEADING TO SLOW CRACK GROWTH AND CREEP RUPTURE.   THE FIELD INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE BENDING LOADS WAS A CUSTOMER HOUSELINE WATER LEAK WHICH ERODED THE SUPPORT FROM UNDER THE SERVICE LINE'S TRANSITION FITTING."

AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 AM, ON JUNE 13, 2020, DOMINION ENERGY NORTH CAROLINA CREWS RECEIVED A 911-CALL REPORTING AN EXPLOSION AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE RESIDENCE IN RALEIGH, NC. 911 REPORTED TO DENC THAT AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE CRAWL SPACE OF THE HOME AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE. DENC CREWS DID NOT OBSERVE ANY FIRE AT THE HOUSE. A CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR THE HOMEOWNER OF 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE WAS REPORTEDLY INJURED AT THE SCENE WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED. AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, THE CONTRACTOR WAS IN THE CRAWL SPACE UNDERNEATH THE HOME PERFORMING WORK ON THE HOMEOWNER'S HVAC SYSTEM. THE CONTRACTOR WAS REPORTEDLY BURNED BY THE EXPLOSION AND WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE LOCAL BURN HOSPITAL.  THE FOUR NEIGHBORING HOMES, ALONG WITH 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE, WERE ALL EVACUATED (I.E.1345, 1347, 1349, 1401, 1403 COURTLAND DRIVE). ALL RESIDENTS OF 1345, 1347, AND 1349 REMAIN DISPLACED. THE RESIDENTS OF 1401 AND 1403 HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES. THE HOME AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE SUSTAINED STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND IS NOT HABITABLE.   WHILE THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN AND CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION IS ONGOING, A NATURAL GAS LEAK WAS OBSERVED NEAR THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE STEEL TAPPING TEE AND THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE THAT SERVED 1345 COURTLAND DRIVE. A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF GAS LEAKED IS 13.8 MCF. (THE LOST GAS AMOUNT IS PENDING FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THE LEAK FLOW RATE WAS ESTIMATED AT 100 CUBIC FEET PER DAY SINCE THE INSTALLATION DATE OF JANUARY 27, 2020. THE REPORTED LOST GAS AMOUNT WILL BE UPDATED AFTER THE FLOW RATE ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED ON THE LEAKING FITTING.) OVERTURNED ACETYLENE TANKS WERE ALSO NOTED IN THE CRAWL SPACE OF 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE AFTER THE INCIDENT.      THE RESPONDING DENC CREW TRACED THE LEAK TO THE CONNECTION TO THE SERVICE SERVING 1345 COURTLAND DRIVE AND STOPPED THE LEAK BY RUNNING THE TAPPING TEE CUTTER DOWN.  AS A PRECAUTION, THE TAPPING TEE AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE WAS ALSO SHUT OFF BY RUNNING DOWN THE TAPPING TEE PERFORATOR/STOP FOR THE SERVICE LINE.  BOTH SERVICES WERE LATER DISCONNECTED, AND STEEL CAPS WERE WELDED ON.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE MAIN IN FRONT OF 1345, 1347 AND 1349 COURTLAND DRIVE WAS EXPOSED AND VERIFIED THERE WERE NO LEAKS.

A DISTRIBUTION CREW WAS DISPATCHED AND ARRIVED ON-SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 23:16 HOURS. DUE TO EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND FLOODING IN THE AREA, CE PERSONNEL WAS STAGED THROUGHOUT THE AREA TO ASSESS NATURAL GAS FACILITIES AND RESPOND TO GAS EMERGENCIES.     AN INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED A 4"" STEEL MP PIPELINE DAMAGED. THE PIPELINE WAS SEVERED WHEN SIGNIFICANT FLOODING IN THE AREA CAUSED A ROAD WASH-OUT. A MUELLER FITTING WAS INSTALLED TO CONTAIN THE BLOWING GAS.  BECAUSE THE PIPELINE WAS A ONE FEED, A LOSS OF SERVICE TO APPROXIMATELY 360 CUSTOMERS OCCURRED.    A PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO UTILIZE COMPRESSES NATURAL GAS (CNG) TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY SERVICE TO THE MAJORITY OF THE IMPACTED CUSTOMERS UNTIL A PERMANENT PLAN COULD BE COORDINATED WITH THE GLADWIN AND MIDLAND COUNTY ROADWAY COMMISSIONS.    ON JUNE 16, 2020 SERVICE WAS REINSTATED TO THE MAJORITY OF IMPACTED CUSTOMERS BY COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 6.25 MILES OF NEW GAS DISTRIBUTION MAIN. ADDITIONAL MAIN INSTALLATION IS NEEDED TO REINSTATE THE REMAINING CUSTOMERS (APPROXIMATELY EIGHT CUSTOMER REMAINING).  THE ANTICIPATED COMPLETION DATE IS JULY, 15, 2020.      THE PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION NECESSARY TO SERVE THE REMAINING EIGHT CUSTOMERS WAS COMPLETED ON JULY 24, 2020."

BASED ON THE VINTAGE OF FIELD WRAP, THE ORIGINAL COATING DAMAGE OCCURRED PRIOR TO 1993. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE (I.E. DENT, SCRATCH OR WALL LOSS) TO THE PIPELINE. THE OXIDATION (CORROSION) OCCURRED DUE TO A POOR APPLICATION OF THE FIELD WRAP.    ON JANUARY 31, 2020, THE TO DATE REPAIR COST WAS $45,000. IGC WILL INCUR A MINIMUM OF $5,000 IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THIS SPRING WHEN THE TEMPORARY ASPHALT IS REPLACED WITH PERMANENT ASPHALT, AT WHICH TIME THE TOTAL REPAIR COSTS WILL EXCEED $50,000.

PGW IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED FIRST RESPONDERS TO INVESTIGATE. THE FIRST PGW EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 11:49 AM. UPON ARRIVAL THREE PROPERTIES WERE ON FIRE (1433, 1435, & 1437 S. 8TH STREET) AND THE DEBRIS FIELD WAS CONSISTENT WITH A POTENTIAL EXPLOSION. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE PFD, PGW  PERFORMED HOUSE CHECKS AND THE PFD EVACUATED APPROXIMATELY 60 PEOPLE DURING THE EVENT.     A 6"" CAST IRON GAS MAIN SUPPLIED THE GAS SERVICES TO THE PROPERTIES ON FIRE. IN ORDER TO SHUT DOWN THE GAS MAIN AND SERVICES TO THESE PROPERTIES PGW UTILIZED GREASE INJECTED THROUGH THE SERVICES OF 1421 AND 1441 S. 8TH STREET. THE MAIN AND SERVICES WERE SHUT DOWN AT 13:27. THE PERMANENT CUT AND CAPS OF THE 6"" CAST IRON MAIN WERE COMPLETED AT 17:30.     ON 12/19/19 AT 23:00 PGW INSERTED A CAMERA INSIDE THE ABANDONED 6"" CAST IRON GAS MAIN AND IDENTIFIED A POTENTIAL BROKEN MAIN LOCATION. THE CAMERA VIEW WAS HINDERED DUE TO THE MAIN BEING FILLED WITH WATER. ON 12/21/19 (AFTER THE WATER HAD BEEN DRAINED FROM THE MAIN) PGW INSERTED THE CAMERA AGAIN AND IDENTIFIED A CLEAR CIRCUMFERENTIAL BREAK WHERE THE MAIN HAD DROPPED. THE LOCATION OF THE BROKEN MAIN WAS 136 FEET NNCL OF DICKINSON STREET.     ON 12/22/19 PGW WAS GIVEN ACCESS TO EXCAVATE AND RETRIEVE THE 6"" CAST IRON BROKEN MAIN FOR EVIDENCE. THE FOOTWAY AND ROADWAY PAVEMENT WAS UNDERMINED AT THIS LOCATION AND A LARGE CAVITY EXISTED IN THE INTERSECTION OF 1400 S. 8TH STREET AND 800 WILDER STREET.  A 6"" STAINLESS STEEL SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED ON THE BROKEN MAIN AND THIS SECTION OF MAIN WAS MARKED AND REMOVED FOR EVIDENCE.     THE TESTING AND METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED DUE TO THE CURRENT WORK STOPPAGE CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE TESTING WILL BE RESCHEDULED AFTER THE PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN LIFTED.     THE TESTING AND METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE ON 6/24/2020 AT AFFILIATED ENGINEERING LABORATORIES, INC. 777 NEW DURHAM ROAD, EDISON NJ 08817.     ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 THE TESTING ANALYSIS WAS PROVIDED TO PGW AND THE PENNSYLVANIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION. THE SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS CONCLUDED EXTERNAL STRESSES APPLIED TO A GRAPHITIZED GAS MAIN INDUCED A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK WHEREBY GAS WAS ALLOWED TO ESCAPE.

IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT AN EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED AT A PRIVATE RESIDENCE AND TWO OCCUPANTS WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.      VERBAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE BILLINGS FIRE DEPARTMENT INDICATED TWO OCCUPANTS WERE TAKEN TO THE BILLINGS HOSPITAL AND THEN FLOWN TO A HOSPITAL IN DENVER.      A LEAK INVESTIGATION OUTSIDE THE RESIDENCE WAS COMPLETED, GAS WAS INDICATED AT THE RISER OF THE RESIDENCE WITH HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF GAS AT THE INTERSECTION OF TWO 1982 VINTAGE 1 1/4"" PLASTIC MAINS ACROSS THE ALLEY.  THE MAINS FEEDING THE TEE WERE ISOLATED, SECURING THE LEAK AT 05:50 ON NOVEMBER 18, 2019.  THE MAIN WAS EXCAVATED AND A CRACK WAS DISCOVERED AT THE INTERFACE OF THE PIPE AT A SOCKET TEE CONNECTING THE MAINS.      FACTORS THAT CAUSED THE GAS TO BE CONTROLLED AT 5:50 WERE THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A LEAK INVESTIGATION TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE SURROUNDING STRUCTURES, PINPOINT THE SUSPECTED SOURCE OF THE GAS, GET EMERGENCY LOCATES COMPLETED, EXCAVATE THE LOCATION OF THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF GAS TO ENSURE THE LOCATION OF LEAK, AND EXCAVATE TWO LOCATIONS FOR SHUT OFF OF THE GAS DUE TO THE AREA BEING SERVED FROM TWO LOCATIONS.       UPON EXCAVATION, THE PIPE AT THE TEE LOCATION, HAD A DEFLECTION FROM THE MAIN LINE WHICH WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD INSTALLATION OF THE PIPE.  THIS DEFLECTION MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED FROM IMPROPER SUPPORT DURING THIRD PARTY EXCAVATION OR IMPROPER BACKFILL METHODS POST THIRD PARTY EXCAVATION THAT OCCURRED SOMETIME AFTER MONTANA-DAKOTA'S INITIAL INSTALLATION OF THE PIPE.  FURTHER INDICATION THAT OUTSIDE FORCES CAUSED THE CRACK INCLUDE BACKFILL MATERIAL SURROUNDING THE PIPE AND TEE THAT APPEARED TO BE FOREIGN FROM NATIVE MATERIALS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED AT TIME OF INITIAL INSTALLATION.    4/8/2021 - THE PE PIPE MATERIAL WAS REVISED TO CORRECT FROM PE 2406 TO PE 2306.      4/19/2021 - THE NUMBERS FOR GAS RELEASED (PG. 1 ITEMS 7) AND GAS CONSUMED (PG. 2 ITEM 21C) ARE NOT KNOWN.

SCUD EMPLOYEES RECEIVED THE PAGE AND CONFIRMED THAT THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDING. BOB TRENTHAM WAS THE FIRST SCUD EMPLOYEE ON THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 9:25 PM. UPON ARRIVAL, THE SEVIERVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT (SFD) AND SEVIERVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT (SPD) ALONG WITH SURROUNDING FIRE DEPARTMENTS WERE ON THE SCENE AND PERFORMING FIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS ON THE CABIN AND TRUCK THAT WERE BOTH ON FIRE. ADDITIONAL SCUD EMPLOYEES BEGAN ARRIVING SHORTLY AFTER BOB AND WE STARTED COORDINATION TO TURN THE GAS OFF. SPD SECURED THE SCENE AND WERE ONLY ALLOWING EMERGENCY PERSONNEL PAST A CHECKPOINT ~0.2 MILES FROM THE SCENE. SCUD GIS MAPS WERE REVIEWED TO ASSESS THE LOCATION OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE TO CABIN 4020, ALONG WITH THE GAS MAINS AND VALVES IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE METER. SCUD EMPLOYEES OPERATED COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATORS (CGI'S) TO MONITOR THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS IN THE AIR AROUND THIS LOCATION.      THE SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS IS A 2'PE MAIN WITH A ONE-WAY SUPPLY OPERATING AT 45 PSIG. SCUD VALVE #71L 17 (LOCATED ~250' UPSTREAM OF THE CABIN) WAS OPERATED AT ~9:45 PM TO TURN THE GAS OFF. THE DOWNSTREAM SCUD VALVE #71L 6 (LOCATED ~1,550' DOWNSTREAM OF THE CABIN) WAS ALSO OPERATED TO LIMIT THE LOSS OF GAS AND IN HOPES OF MAINTAINING PRESSURE FOR THE 88 CUSTOMERS DOWNSTREAM OF VALVE #71L 17. THE 3/4' PE GAS SERVICE LINE TO 604 WALNUT WAY WAS EXPOSED BY HAND-DIGGING AND THE LINE WAS SQUEEZED OFF. THIS SERVICE LINE WAS INSTALLED ON 2-19-1993, SO THERE WAS NO EXCESS FLOW VALVE. THE 'LINEPACK' VOLUME OF GAS STORED IN THE PIPELINE DOWNSTREAM OF VALVE #71L 6 WAS CONSUMED BY THE DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS AND THE MAIN LINE WENT FLAT BEFORE THE GAS SERVICE ON THE MAIN COULD BE RESTORED. AT 11:20 PM, THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS REPORTED THAT THE FIRE IS CONTAINED. GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED ON THE 2'PE MAIN AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30 PM. THE TEMPERATURE WAS 35F AND CUSTOMERS NEEDED HEAT FOR THE NIGHT. ADDITIONAL SCUD PERSONNEL WAS CALLED IN TO ASSIST WITH THE RESTORATION OF SERVICE AND LIGHT-UPS OF THE GAS APPLIANCES. NATURAL GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO ALL OF THE 88 AFFECTED HOMES (EXCEPT TWO UNOCCUPIED CABINS) WHEN SCUD EMPLOYEES LEFT THE SCENE EARLY SUNDAY MORNING.    JAMES GREENE CALLED TENNESSEE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION'S (TPUC) GAS PIPELINE SAFETY DIVISION (GPSD) DEPUTY DIRECTOR TRAVIS ASLINGER TO NOTIFY HIM OF THE INCIDENT AT 10:47 PM ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 16. AFTER THAT CONVERSATION, JAMES CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AT 10:55 PM TO FILE AN INITIAL REPORT FOR THE INCIDENT (REPORT #1264126). ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, JAMES CALLED THE NRC PROVIDE A 48-HOUR UPDATE (REPORT #1264233).     ACCORDING TO THE SPD INCIDENT REPORT, CASE NUMBER 2019037915, 'OFFICERS WERE DISPATCHED TO 604 WALNUT WAY REGARDING A CABIN FIRE THAT WAS STARTED BY A VEHICLE CRASH. UPON ARRIVAL, THE CABIN WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. A WHITE PICKUP TRUCK HAD ROLLED BACKWARDS DOWN THE HILL OFF OF THE ROAD AND SMASHED INTO THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, BREAKING THE GAS LINE AND CAUSING AN EXPLOSION.' THERE WERE FOUR FEMALE OCCUPANTS IN THE CABIN THAT WERE ABLE TO EVACUATE THE CABIN. WHEN SPD ARRIVED, THE MAN ADMITTED HE WAS THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK AND HE HAD BEEN HEAVILY DRINKING. HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PLACED UNDER ARREST FOR DUI AND IMPLIED CONSENT AND TRANSPORTED TO JAIL.    SCUD HAD 18 EMPLOYEES ON THE SCENE AT SOME POINT SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. ON SUNDAY, SCUD EMPLOYEES WENT BACK TO THE SCENE TO ASSESS THE SITUATION DURING DAYLIGHT. THEY OBSERVED THE BURNT TRUCK WHERE IT CRASHED INTO THE HOUSE AND KNOCKED A HOLE IN THE CRAWLSPACE. THE TRUCK STRUCK THE GAS METER (WHICH WAS UNDER THE BACKSIDE OF THE TRUCK), BROKE THE TOP PART OF THE RISER OFF, AND BENT THE BOTTOM PART OF THE BROKEN RISER INTO THE CRAWLSPACE OF THE CABIN."

THE PROTOCOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS WERE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY DEO AND THE PUCO. DNV ISSUED ITS FINAL METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT ON 5-18-20, AND DEO HAS CONCLUDED ITS REVIEW OF THE INCIDENT.  ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT INDICATES THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF AXIAL BENDING STRESSES ON THE PIPE STRING, LIKELY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF A CAVERN OR VOID IN THE ROCK FORMATION THROUGH WHICH THE AUGER PASSED, WHICH CAUSED THE AUGER TO VEER OFF COURSE. THE BENDING STRESS CAUSED THE FIELD GIRTH WELD LOCATED AT THE EDGE OF THE CAVERN TO FAIL, PRIMARILY IN DUCTILE OVERLOAD.

UPON INVESTIGATING FURTHER, IT APPEARS AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE ENTERED ONTO THE STEEL GAS PIPING AND STEEL WATER PIPING AS A RESULT OF A VEHICLE RUNNING INTO A UTILITY POLE AT 2401 EAGLE DRIVE. THE CURRENT APPEARS TO HAVE ENTERED ONTO THE GAS PIPING FROM THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET (3001 EAGLE DRIVE) FROM THE UTILITY POLE ACCIDENT AS THE UNION AT THE METER SET HAD A HOLE BURNED INTO IT. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ELECTRICIANS AND PLUMBERS WERE ADDRESSING AN ELECTRICAL OUTAGE AND WATER PIPE LEAKS UNDER THE SAME ADDRESS AS IT APPEARS A LARGE AMOUNT OF CURRENT MAY HAVE TRAVELED THROUGH THE STRUCTURE. FOUR HOUSES DOWN FROM THE UTILITY POLE ACCIDENT (3010 EAGLE DRIVE) THE STEEL NATURAL GAS SERVICE PIPE WAS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE STEEL WATER SERVICE PIPE TO SAME PROPERTY. THE ELECTRICAL CHARGE CAUSED THE TWO (2) PIPES TO FUSE TOGETHER CAUSING A LEAK IN BOTH RESULTING IN 60 PSIG WATER ENTERING THE 40 PSIG GAS SYSTEM AT THAT POINT. APPROXIMATELY 7,000 FEET OF NATURAL GAS MAIN WAS ISOLATED WITH ASSOCIATED SERVICES IN ORDER FOR THE WATER BE EXTRACTED FROM THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM.  APPROXIMATELY 139 NATURAL GAS METER SETS WERE AFFECTED DUE TO WATER ENTERING THE NATURAL GAS PIPING SYSTEM. DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TIME PERFORMING THE INVESTIGATION AND REPAIRS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT COSTS WOULD EXCEED THE $50,000 THRESHOLD FOR REPORTING WHERE THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS CONTACTED AT THAT TIME.

NVE GAS DISPATCH CONTACTED A NVE GAS SERVICEMAN AND INSPECTOR TO RESPOND.  NVE PERSONNEL ON SCENE WERE ATTEMPTING TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF GAS WHEN TWO RENO FIREFIGHTERS OPERATED THE MAIN CIRCUIT BREAKER ON THE ELECTRIC PANEL THAT WAS 36"" FROM THE DAMAGED, LEAKING RISER AT THE GAS METER SET.  THIS CAUSED A FLASH IGNITION OF NATURAL GAS THAT BURNED THE TWO RENO FIREFIGHTERS.  THE TWO RENO FIREFIGHTERS WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE THEY WERE TREATED AND RELEASED THAT SAME DAY.  A SHORT TIME LATER, AFTER THE FIRST IGNITION, A SECOND IGNITION OCCURRED IN THE ATTIC OF THE HOME ABOVE THE GARAGE CAUSING A FIRE IN THE ATTIC SPACE.    NVE PERSONNEL ISOLATED GAS AT A MAIN VALVE, RESULTING IN AN OUTAGE TO 11 CUSTOMERS AND STOPPING THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE DAMAGED RISER.  THE SERVICE LINE TO THE DAMAGED RISER WAS RETIRED AT THE CURB AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE 10 OTHER AFFECTED CUSTOMERS.    NVE PERSONNEL OBSERVATION, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, AND TESTIMONY BY RENO FIRE PERSONNEL INDICATE THAT THE METER SET WAS DAMAGED BY THE HOMEOWNER WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO MOVE HIS RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PAST THE METER SET.  THE RECREATIONAL VEHICLE STEP WAS NOT RETRACTED AND IT CONTACTED THE METER SET AS HE WAS DRIVING FORWARD.  THE THREADED JOINT BETWEEN THE GAS METER VALVE AND THE RISER WAS CRACKED DUE TO THIS IMPACT.    NVE MANAGEMENT ON SCENE DETERMINED THAT THE PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE HOME WOULD EXCEED $50,000 FOR THIS EVENT.

THE GERC IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED CON EDISON GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) PERSONNEL AND SUPERVISORS TO THE LOCATION. THE BUILDING INVOLVED WAS SUPPLIED BY A 1-INCH HIGH-PRESSURE HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE (HDPE) GAS SERVICE (INSTALLED IN 2004). AT 07:58, THE CHFD REPORTED A SECONDARY GAS IGNITION AT THE METER SET UP LOCATED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. ADDITIONAL CON EDISON PERSONNEL FROM GDS, GAS CONSTRUCTION, AND THE GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE GROUP (ERG) WERE THEN DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION BY THE GERC. GDS ARRIVED AT 08:06 AND CONFIRMED THE REPORTED SECONDARY GAS IGNITION. AT 08:35, GDS CLOSED THE CURB VALVE ON THE 1-INCH HDPE GAS SERVICE TO 1007 HALF BAY MOON DRIVE, THEREBY EXTINGUISHING THE SECONDARY FIRE AT THE OUTDOOR GAS METER SET UP; HOWEVER, THE STRUCTURAL FIRE REMAINED ONGOING AT THAT TIME. AS A PRECAUTION, GDS ALSO CLOSED THE HEAD-OF-SERVICE VALVES TO 1004, 1005, AND 1006 HALF MOON BAY DRIVE AT THEIR OUTDOOR METER SETS. IN ADDITION, NEARBY RADIAL HIGH-PRESSURE MAIN VALVE #39289 WAS LOCATED AND STAFFED FOR CONTINGENCY ISOLATION PURPOSES. AT 11:25, GDS REPORTED THAT THE CHFD HAD EXTINGUISHED THE STRUCTURAL FIRE. A SPECIAL LEAK SURVEY WAS PERFORMED BY CON EDISON AND NO GAS ODORS OR READINGS WERE DETECTED. GDS PERFORMED AN INTEGRITY TEST ON THE HOUSE PIPING INSIDE 1007 HALF MOON BAY DRIVE DOWNSTREAM OF THE GAS METER AND THE TEST PASSED. CON EDISON GAS CONSTRUCTION ALSO PERFORMED A PRESSURE TEST ON THE GAS SERVICE LINE, FROM THE CURB VALVE TO THE HEAD-OF SERVICE VALVE, UNDER LINE PRESSURE (60 PSI), AND THE TEST PASSED.  PRESSURE AND ODORANT READINGS WERE WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE RANGES. CON EDISON PERSONNEL CUT AND CAPPED THE GAS SERVICE LINE TO 1007 HALF MOON BAY DRIVE AT THE CURB VALVE AND ISSUED A WARNING TAG. BASED ON THEIR INVESTIGATION, THE CHFD REPORTED THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS UNDETERMINED. IT WAS NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT INTERIOR RENOVATIONS WERE ONGOING IN 1007 HALF MOON BAY DRIVE AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE. THERE WERE NO REPORTED INJURIES. MULTIPLE MEDIA OUTLETS WERE ON LOCATION.

A SUBSEQUENT PRESSURE TEST OF THE SERVICE LINE DID NOT HOLD PRESSURE.    INITIAL EXCAVATION OF THE FACILITIES DETERMINED CAUSE OF LEAKAGE TO BE A LEAKING SOCKET FUSION ON A TRANSITION FITTING THAT TRANSITIONED THE 1/2-INCH PE SERVICE PIPE TO THE 3/4-INCH STEEL SERVICE RISER.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED A CRACK IN THE BODY OF THE 1/2-INCH PE SERVICE PIPE TO BE THE CAUSE OF LEAKAGE.  THE ORIGINAL REPORT FOR THIS INCIDENT DOCUMENTED THE APPARENT CAUSE IN PART G AS ""G8 - OTHER INCIDENT CAUSE"" AS THE CAUSE OF THE LEAKING SOCKET FUSION AT THE TIME WAS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.  AS THE ABOVE NOTED CRACK WAS FOUND, THE APPARENT CAUSE IN PART G HAS BEEN CHANGED TO ""G5 - PIPE, WELD, OR JOINT FAILURE"" - BODY OF PIPE - CRACK.  THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF GAS THAT WAS RELEASED FROM THE TIME THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED UNTIL THE FACILITIES WERE CUT AND CAPPED (5HOURS - 1 MINUTE) WAS 402.6 MCF.

A GAS SERVICE WORKER (GSW) AND DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 16:35 AND 16:41 HOURS RESPECTIVELY.  THE GSW MONITORED THE SITE CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL THE DAMAGED PIPELINE SEGMENT WAS ISOLATED AND THE BLOWING GAS CONTAINED.    POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL WERE ONSITE AND PORTIONS OF THE ROAD WERE CLOSED AS A SAFETY PRECAUTION.  THERE WERE NO FATALITIES OR INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE DAMAGE.    THE PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED AT APPROXIMATELY 19:17 HOURS BY SQUEEZING AN 8"" PLASTIC PIPELINE AT THE CONSUMERS ENERGY'S ZILWAUKEE CITY GATE (CUT AND CAP NORTH OF THE DAMAGE) AND CLOSING VALVE M1312 TO THE SOUTH OF THE DAMAGE LOCATION.  ONCE THE PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED AND BLOWING GAS CONTAINED, A LOCATION UPSTREAM OF VALVE M1312 WAS CUT AND CAPPED.    AN INCIDENT INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE ROOT CAUSE AS A THIRD PARTY DAMAGE. SEVERAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DAMAGE WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED AS FOLLOWS (1) FACILITY NOT LOCATED OR MARKED - THE ONE CALL TICKET POSITIVE RESPONSE 001(NO CONFLICT) WAS PROVIDED BY THE STAKING CONTRACTOR FOLLOWING A CONVERSATION WITH A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY INSTALLING DRAIN TILES. (2) UNCLEAR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CE STAKING CONTRACTOR AND THE CONTRACTOR INSTALLING THE DRAINAGE TILE.

EXCAVATOR STATED THAT THE 4-INCH GAS MAIN WAS SPOTTED PRIOR TO EXCAVATION BEGAN; HOWEVER, THE SOFT DIG TOOK PLACE APPROX. 10 FT NORTH OF THE CROSSING POINT. EXCAVATOR FURTHER STATED THE DEPTH OF GAS MAIN AT THE POINT OF CONFLICT WAS ASSUMED TO BE THE SAME DEPTH AS WHERE THE SPOT DIG TOOK PLACE.    THE RUPTURE WAS ISOLATED BY SQUEEZING OFF THE 4-INCH GAS MAIN AT APPROXIMATELY 23:30, 7/25/19, AS A RESULT GAS SERVICE TO 27 ACTIVE CUSTOMERS WAS INTERRUPTED. THE DEPTH OF DAMAGED SECTION OF THE 4-INCH GAS MAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 9FT, WHICH WAS DAMAGED BY A DIRECTIONAL DRILL DURING PULLBACK. THE DAMAGED SECTION WAS REPLACED WITH PRESSURE TESTED SECTION OF 4-INCH PE AND SERVICES WERE RELIT SUBSEQUENTLY.    THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE FAILURE OF THE EXCAVATOR TO COMPLY WITH F.S 556.105.5(C): EXCAVATOR DID NOT SPOT DIG THE UNDERGROUND UTILITY BEFORE USING MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT WITHIN THE TOLERANCE ZONE OF THE MARKED UTILITY AND AT THE POINT OF CROSSING."

AT THE HOUSE, GAS HAD IGNITED ON THE UNION FOR THE FILTER RIGHT ABOVE THE LOCK-WING SERVICE VALVE AND SET THE HOME ON FIRE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ABLE TO TURN THE GAS OFF AT THE LOCK-WING SERVICE VALVE, ON THE METER SET, AND EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES.  AT THE POWER POLE, AFTER DETERMINING THAT THERE WAS NO GAS MIGRATING UNDERGROUND, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO DIG UP THE 2"" STEEL MAIN IN REMOTE HOLES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FIRE AND SQUEEZE THE LINE OFF. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A SQUIRREL SHORTED THE OVERHEAD POWER FACILITY TO THE GROUND ON THE POWER POLE. THE GROUND ROD FOR THE POLE WAS WITHIN 6"" OF THE 2"" COATED AND WRAPPED STEEL GAS MAIN. THE GROUNDED CURRENT CAUSED AN ARC BURN HOLE IN THE PIPE AT THE GROUND ROD AND AT THE HOUSE RISER CAUSING FIRES AT BOTH LOCATIONS.

THE EXCAVATOR PROCEEDED TO DIG TO EXCAVATE THE MAIN AND DAMAGED THE BURIED, UNMARKED 3/4"" STEEL HIGH PRESSURE GAS SERVICE, TEARING THE SERVICE IN TWO DOWNSTREAM OF THE SERVICE TEE OFF THE MAIN.

A COMPLETE NARRATIVE WAS PROVIDED TO US DOT PHMSA ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION DIVISION ON 1/30/20.     PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NORTH CAROLINA, INCORPORATED D/B/A NAME IS DOMINION ENERGY NORTH CAROLINA.   PSNC IS USED IN THIS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL REPORT.    ON THE MORNING OF APRIL 10, 2019, A THIRD-PARTY TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONTRACTOR (OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY LLC), WHILE IN THE PROCESS OF BORING NEW FACILITIES VIA HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING ALONG NORTH DUKE STREET IN DURHAM, NC, DAMAGED BELOW-GROUND SERVICE LINE PIPING IN PSNCS NATURAL GAS SYSTEM.  OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY'S THREE-PERSON CREW STRUCK AND DAMAGED THE SERVICE LINE FEEDING THE STRUCTURE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET AT APPROXIMATELY 9:06AM. OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY'S CREW DID NOT CALL 911 BUT NOTIFIED NC-811, THE STATE'S ONE-CALL OFFICE, OF THE DAMAGE AT APPROXIMATELY 9:31AM.  NC-811 AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED A DAMAGE TICKET, WHICH WAS DELIVERED TO PSNC AT APPROXIMATELY 9:35AM.  AN ORDER WAS AUTOMATICALLY DISPATCHED TO PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER AT APPROXIMATELY 9:36AM.  THE FIRST RESPONDER REVIEWED THE TICKET AT APPROXIMATELY 9:43AM AND BEGAN HEADING TO THE SITE.  PSNC RECEIVED A CALL FROM 911 AT APPROXIMATELY 9:48AM, NOTING THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ALREADY ON THE SCENE. PSNC'S DISPATCH CONTACTED THE FIRST RESPONDER EN ROUTE TO ADVISE HIM OF A GAS ODOR AND A DAMAGED LINE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ISSUED A COMBINATION OF EVACUATION AND SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS AT APPROXIMATELY 9:58AM.  PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:03AM.  BETWEEN HIS ARRIVAL AND APPROXIMATELY 10:06AM, PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER AS WELL AS PSNC'S DISPATCH CONTACTED ADDITIONAL PSNC RESOURCES TO ASSIST WITH SECURING AND MAKING THE GAS LEAK SAFE. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:06AM, THE STRUCTURE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET EXPLODED.  BETWEEN 10:26AM AND 10:50AM, ADDITIONAL PSNC EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING A CONSTRUCTION CREW, ARRIVED AT THE SITE. CREWS CONVENED AT THE INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER TO EVALUATE OPTIONS TO SHUT OFF THE GAS FLOW.  BY11:05AM, THE CREWS IDENTIFIED THE PROPER VALVE, SECURED THE NECESSARY TOOLS, AND, AT APPROXIMATELY 11:10AM, SHUT OFF GAS FLOW TO THE IMPACTED AREA BY CLOSING A VALVE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY THREE BLOCKS FROM THE SCENE.      THE EXPLOSION KILLED THE OCCUPANT OF THE STRUCTURE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET.  THE EXPLOSION ALSO SEVERELY INJURED A MEMBER OF OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY'S CREW, THE OWNER/OPERATOR OF PS SPLICING LLC (WHICH HIRED OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY TO PERFORM THE HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING WORK), PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER, AND A FIREFIGHTER.  AN ESTIMATED 25 PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION AND TAKEN TO LOCAL AREA HOSPITALS, AND 6 INDIVIDUALS WERE REPORTEDLY ADMITTED.  PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER DIED IN THE HOSPITAL ON APRIL 25, 2019 AS A RESULT OF INJURIES THAT HE SUSTAINED IN THE EXPLOSION.  THE EXPLOSION RESULTED IN THE STRUCTURES AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET AND 111 NORTH DUKE STREET BEING CONDEMNED BY THE DURHAM FIRE DEPARTMENT.  BOTH STRUCTURES HAVE SINCE BEEN DEMOLISHED.  APPROXIMATELY 15 BUILDINGS IN TOTAL WERE REPORTEDLY DAMAGED BY THE EXPLOSION.      PSNC'S INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT THE SERVICE LINE TO THE STRUCTURE AT 115 NORTH DUKE STREET WAS STRUCK AND DAMAGED DURING OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY'S HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING WORK.  APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR LATER, AND ONLY 3 MINUTES AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF PSNC'S FIRST RESPONDER TO THE SCENE, THE ESCAPING GAS FROM THE DAMAGED SERVICE LINE IGNITED AND RESULTED IN THE EXPLOSION.  PSNC'S UNDERGROUND FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE SERVICE LINE, WERE ACCURATELY LOCATED AND MARKED BY PSNC'S CONTRACTOR (SOUTHERN CROSS INC.) PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THE EXPLOSION, BUT OPTIC CABLE TECHNOLOGY'S CREW FAILED TO POT-HOLE AND VERIFY THE LOCATION OF THE SERVICE LINE UNDER THE SIDEWALK AS PART OF THEIR HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING WORK."

DURING THIS INVESTIGATION A LEAK WAS DETECTED ON A MECHANICAL NUT FOLLOWER COUPLING ON THE 2IN STEEL MAIN WHICH WAS SECURED AT 04:48 3/21/2019.  FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATION PROVED NO INDICATION OF LEAKS ON THE JURISDICTIONAL SERVICE LINE.  ADDITIONALLY, TESTING OF CUSTOMER OWNED FACILITIES PROVIDED NO INDICATION OF MATERIAL LEAKS.   THE MAIN HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN 1962.  NO INDICATIONS OF A LEAK WERE FOUND IN THE PRIOR TWO LEAK SURVEYS, CONDUCTED IN 2014 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.   IN THE ABSENCE OF ANOTHER IDENTIFIABLE SOURCE, THE LEAKING MECHANICAL FITTING ON THE MAIN MAY HAVE BEEN A SOURCE OF FUEL FOR THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED.  HOWEVER, AN IDENTIFIED PATH OF MIGRATION HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED FOR THE SOURCE OF FUEL TO ENTER THE HOME.    EXTREME WINTER TEMPERATURE AND FROST CONDITIONS AT THE MECHANICAL FITTING MAY HAVE AFFECTED SOIL CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE FITTING ALONG WITH POTENTIAL FOR ABNORMAL CONTRACTION/EXPANSION OF THE FITTING AND PIPE COMPONENTS.

VAN WEISS BLVD IN WEST BURLINGTON, IOWA STATING SHE HAD SOME WORK DONE AROUND HER HOUSE AND A CLUMP OF DIRT FELL ON HER GAS METER AND SHE COULD SMELL AND HEAR NATURAL GAS LEAKING.  THE CUSTOMER WAS INSTRUCTED TO EVACUATE THE HOUSE.  IPL DISPATCHED A SERVICE MECHANIC, WHO ARRIVED ONSITE AT 13:26 TO FIND THE GAS HAD IGNITED.  HE IMMEDIATELY REQUESTED ADDITIONAL GAS PERSONNEL FOR ASSISTANCE.  POLICE WERE ALREADY ONSITE AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTER AND SPRAYED WATER ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE UNTIL THE GAS COULD BE SHUT OFF.  DUE TO THE FROZEN GROUND, HAND DIGGING TO EXPOSE THE SERVICE LINE WAS DIFFICULT.  AFTER TWO ADDITIONAL IPL EMPLOYEES ARRIVED WITH A MINI-EXCAVATOR, THE 3/4 INCH STEEL SERVICE LINE WAS EXPOSED AND SQUEEZED OFF AT APPROXIMATELY 14:50, ALLOWING FIREFIGHTERS TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE.  SHORTLY AFTER, THE SERVICE LINE WAS EXPOSED AT THE SERVICE TEE AND WAS CUT OFF AND CAPPED.    A BASEMENT CONTRACTOR HAD BEEN PERFORMING EXTERIOR BASEMENT WALL REPAIR WORK AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE HOUSE AND HAD EXPOSED THE STEEL SERVICE LINE ALONG THE EAST SIDE OF THE HOUSE.  IPL IS UNAWARE WHETHER THE CONTRACTOR PROVIDED ANY SUPPORT TO THE EXPOSED SERVICE LINE IN THE EXCAVATION.  THERE WAS NO ACTIVE WORK BEING PERFORMED BY THE CONTRACTOR AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE TRENCH WALL COLLAPSED ONTO THE SERVICE LINE AND RISER, CAUSING THE THREADS ON THE 3/4 INCH NIPPLE AT THE INLET TO THE SERVICE REGULATOR TO BREAK OFF COMPLETELY.  THIS ALLOWED GAS OPERATING AT 55 PSIG TO ESCAPE ALONG THE OUTER BASEMENT WALL.  THE GAS WAS IGNITED BY AN UNKNOWN SOURCE, POSSIBLY STATIC OR BY ROCKS BEING BLOWN AROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE GAS.    THE INCIDENT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY REPORTED ON MARCH 9, 2019, AS INITIAL DAMAGE ESTIMATES INDICATED THE DAMAGES WOULD BE LESS THAN $50,000.

DUE TO LONG TERM, HEAVY RAINS THAT OCCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT, THE SATURATED SOIL CREATED A HEAVY OVERBURDEN ON THE INLET PIPING, AND THAT STRAIN CAUSED THE STEEL PORTION OF THAT PIPING TO SEPARATE AT THE COUPLER. THE FIRST RESPONDERS ON SITE DETERMINED TO SHUT THE SYSTEM DOWN FOR SAFETY, MAKE REPAIRS AND RESTORE SERVICE. PERMANENT REPAIRS RENEWED THAT COUPLED PIPE, REPLACING IT WITH ALL WELDED STEEL PIPING.    NRC FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS:  GIVEN THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY NEW INSTALLATION (2018), IS IT POSSIBLE THERE WERE SOME WORKMANSHIP ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE?  WAS THE PIPING INSTALLED IN A BIND?  HOW FAR DID IT SEPARATE WHEN IT PULLED APART?  WERE THE CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS ADHERED TO?    PEOPLES FOLLOW UP ANSWERS:  AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AFTER THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED AND NO POOR WORKMANSHIP ISSUES WERE FOUND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT, WITH ALL CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS BEING ADHERED TO.  AT THE TIME THAT THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED, THE PIPING HAD SEPARATED APPROXIMATELY 3 INCHES AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF MISALIGNMENT AND WAS STILL IN LINE WITH THE INLET RISER IT HAD SEPARATED FROM, INDICATING THAT THE PIPE WAS NOT INSTALLED IN A BIND.   THE NUTS ON THE COUPLING BOLTS WERE FOUND IN THE POSITION OF HAVING BEEN TIGHTENED WELL INTO THE FINAL TORQUED TIGHTENED PHASE.   ALL INDICATIONS POINT TO THE FACT THAT SEVERAL DAYS OF HEAVY RAINS WAS THE PRIMARY FACTOR THAT INITIATED THIS INCIDENT."

A MALE OCCUPANT WAS INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION AND TRANSPORTED TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL.  THE HOME WAS A COMPLETE LOSS WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $59,400.    PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, AT APPROXIMATELY 21:45 HOURS CONSUMERS ENERGY RECEIVED AND RESPONDED TO AN OUTSIDE LEAK INVESTIGATION AT 443 SOUTH BOULEVARD, PONTIAC, MI.  THE GAS SERVICE WORKER (GSW) ARRIVED ONSITE AT APPROXIMATELY 22:18, HEARD BLOWING GAS AT/NEAR THE SERVICE TEE AND REQUESTED A DISTRIBUTION CREW. THE GSW ALSO OBTAINED 6% FREE AIR READS AT THE PROPERTY ENTRANCE AND ADVISED THE OCCUPANTS NOT TO RE-ENTER THE HOME.      WHILE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THE AREA, THE GSW HEARD WHAT HE BELIEVED MAY HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSION NEARBY (APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET FROM THE SOUTH BLVD. LOCATION) AND NOTIFIED HIS FIELD LEADER.    FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE AREA DETERMINED GAS READS (APPROXIMATELY 55% GAS) IN THE SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 73 FEET WEST OF THE SEWER LEAD SERVING 406 IRWIN AVE.  GAS READS WERE ALSO OBTAINED AT 398 IRWIN AVE. RESULTING IN AN EVACUATION OF THE OCCUPANT AT THIS PROPERTY. (FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION, THE SEWER LEAD FOR 406 IRWIN AVENUE WAS LATER DETERMINED TO BE SOUTH OF THE SANITARY SEWER LOCATED AT THE INTERSECTION OF GOING STREET AND IRWIN AVENUE)    THE DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED ON FEBRUARY 3, 2019 AT APPROXIMATELY 00:35 HOURS.  THE SOURCE OF THE BLOWING GAS WAS DETERMINED TO BE A LEAK ON THE 3/4 INCH PIPE THREAD THAT TIED INTO THE HIGH PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE SERVICE LINE, REGULATOR AND SECURITY WERE REPLACED AND GAS READS BEGAN TO DISSIPATE FROM THE SANITARY SEWER.    ON FEBRUARY 20, 2019 THE INTERESTED PARTIES MET ON-SCENE TO CONDUCT A JOINT SCENE INVESTIGATION.  THE PARTIES AGREED THE CURRENT WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROPERTY MADE IT UNSAFE TO PROCEED FORWARD WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  THE JOINT SCENE INVESTIGATION WAS POSTPONED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 DAYS.    UNTIL A FULL ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION CAN BE COMPLETED THE CAUSE AND ORIGIN REMAINS CLASSIFIED AS UNDETERMINED.      ON MARCH 25, 2019 A JOINT SCENE INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED, THE LOCATION WAS CAREFULLY EXCAVATED AND ALL GAS APPLIANCES WERE REMOVED AND TRANSPORTED TO THE SAFETY ENGINEERING LABORATORIES, INC. (SEL) FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATION AND TESTING.    THE FOLLOWING DAY, MARCH 26, 2019 DESTRUCTIVE TESTING FOR THE FAILURE THAT OCCURRED ON THE BURIED REGULATOR LOCATED AT 443 SOUTH BOULEVARD WAS PERFORMED AT THE CONSUMERS ENERGY TRAIL STREET LABORATORY.      ON APRIL 10, 2019 A JOINT SCENE EXAM WAS HELD WITH CONSUMERS ENERGY, SEL AND THE MPSC.  THE BASEMENT OF THE RESIDENCE WAS EXCAVATED AND WATER DRAINED IN THE ATTEMPT TO LOCATE, TRACE AND VIDEO (PHOTOGRAPH) THE SEWER LINE FROM THE INSIDE OF THE HOME TO THE SANITARY SEWER UNDER THE ROADWAY.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION, A HOLE (APPROXIMATELY 4X4) CUT INTO THE TOP OF THE METAL SEWER LINE IN THE BASEMENT BEFORE THE SEWER TRAP WAS DISCOVERED.  THE SEWER LINE ALSO RAN INTO A REPAIRED SINKHOLE AREA ON GOINGS INSTEAD OF IRWIN AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED BY THE CITY OF PONTIAC WATER DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE FROM AN EARLIER INVESTIGATION.    FOLLOWING A SERIES ON INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS THE IGNITION OF NATURAL GAS.  THE IGNITION SOURCE REMAINS UNDETERMINED.  ADDITIONALLY, THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED DUE TO THE LACK OF COOPERATION BY THE LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE PROPERTY'S RESIDENT."

PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION COLUMBIA EMPLOYEES CONDUCTED A LEAK INVESTIGATION, ESTABLISHED A LEAKAGE PERIMETER, REMOVED MANHOLE COVERS TO FACILITATE VENTING, SET UP TRAFFIC CONTROL, CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT, EVACUATED THE EIGHT UNIT APARTMENT BUILDING AND TURNED THE SERVICE OFF TO ALL UNITS.      A LEAK WAS DISCOVERED ON A 6"" BARE STEEL MAIN APPROXIMATELY 85' FROM THE FOUNDATION OF 1245 COLES BLVD UNIT 32.  THE 6"" BARE STEEL MAIN WAS OPERATING AT 38 POUNDS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  A NON-CAUSAL LEAK WAS DETECTED NEARBY ON THE 4"" BARE STEEL MAIN OPERATING AT 3.9 POUNDS.   THE LEAKS WERE REPAIRED AND SERVICE RESTORED TO FIVE OF THE EIGHT UNITS.      COLUMBIA WORKED WITH THE PUCO, STATE FIRE MARSHALL AND THE PORTSMOUTH FIRE DEPARTMENT TO COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION.  IT'S COLUMBIA'S OPINION THAT THE LEAK FROM THE 6"" BARE STEEL MAIN LIKELY MIGRATED THROUGH THE COMBINATION STORM AND SANITARY SEWER INTO THE FLOOR DRAIN OF 1245 COLES BLVD, UNIT 29.  COLUMBIA VERIFIED THAT THE FLOOR DRAIN OF UNIT 29 DIRECTLY COMMUNICATED WITH THE COMBINATION STORM DRAIN AND SANITARY SEWER VIA USE OF A VIDEO CAMERA.

PROVIDED OPERATOR QUALIFICATION AND PROCEDURE INFORMATION TO NCUC ON 2/22/2019 VIA EMAIL.    ORIGINAL PROJECT PLAN  ON 1/7/19, A PSNC ENERGY CONTRACTOR WAS RETIRING A 350 PSIG 4 IN. LATERAL (M-320) OFF ON OUR 8 IN. TRANSMISSION LINE (T-04) IN ASHEVILLE.  THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF THE WORK WAS NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF SWANNANOA RIVER AND FAIRVIEW ROADS.  THIS WORK WAS THE FINAL STEP TO RETIRING A BRIDGE ATTACHMENT ON FAIRVIEW ROAD.  THIS PROJECT INCLUDED REROUTING SOME SECTIONS AND DE-RATING PART OF THE 350 PSIG SYSTEM TO A STANDARD DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PRESSURE OF 60 PSIG.  THIS SECTION OF M-320 USED TO FEED SOME REGULATOR STATIONS THAT ARE NOW RETIRED.   THE ORIGINAL PROJECT PLAN WAS TO EXCAVATE AND RETIRE THE 4 IN. LATERAL SECTION USING A 4 IN. TD WILLIAMSON (TDW) STOP-OFF FITTING AND REPAVE THIS AREA BY 11 PM THAT NIGHT.        SUMMARY OF WHAT HAPPENED  WHEN THE PIPE WAS EXPOSED AT ABOUT 11:00 AM IT WAS DISCOVERED THE PIPE WAS 6 IN. SO 6 IN. FITTINGS OF IDENTICAL PRESSURE SPECIFICATIONS WERE ROUNDED UP. A TDW THREAD-O-RING (TOR WHICH IS BASICALLY A 2IN.  FITTING USED IN THE TAPPING OPERATION) AND THE 6 IN. STOP-OFF FITTING WERE WELDED ON THE PIPE.  THE TOR WAS TAPPED AT ABOUT 6 PM BY OUR TAPPING CONTRACTOR, WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE 6 IN. PIPE WAS ACTUALLY CASING PIPE OVER THE 4 IN. PIPE.  THE PILOT BIT PENETRATED THE 4 IN. LINE CREATING A 3/8 IN. HOLE THAT SENT GAS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS DOWN THE CASING. THE TAPPING CONTRACTOR TECHNICIAN AND THE PIPELINE CONTRACTOR SUPPORT PERSONNEL EVACUATED THE HOLE. PSNC ENERGY HAD AN INSPECTOR ON SITE AND ADDITIONAL PSNC ENERGY PERSONNEL WERE BROUGHT IN TO MONITOR BOTH ENDS OF THE CASINGS FOR GAS MIGRATION. GASEOUS ATMOSPHERE WAS ABOUT 25-30 FT.  RADIUS FROM THE BELL HOLE CONTAINING THE TOR. THE PROJECT DESIGN SPECIFIED THE REMAINING LATERAL STUB TO BE AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE SO THERE WAS NO ROOM TO INSTALL ANOTHER STOP-OFF FITTING. THIS MADE THE REPAIR/SHUT-OFF PLAN MORE COMPLEX. THE SECTION OF TRANSMISSION LINE CONTAINING THE LATERAL CONNECTION WAS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ISOLATED TO STOP THE LEAK. THIS IS A SINGLE FEED SYSTEM SO A BYPASS WAS REQUIRED. PSNC ENERGY WAS ABLE TO ROUND UP TWO TDW 3-WAY TEES (WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO FACILITATE BOTH STOP-OFF AND BYPASS) FROM ANOTHER JOB. TRANSMISSION CONTRACT CREWS WERE BROUGHT IN TO WELD ON THE FITTINGS AND TO WELD UP AND INSTALL A 120 FT. 8 IN. BYPASS. TWO REMOTE BELL HOLES WERE DUG TO INSTALL THE FITTINGS ON T-04. THE SHUTDOWN PROCESS OF INSTALLING FITTINGS AND BYPASS, TESTING AND PURGING THE BYPASS, STOPPING OFF THE DAMAGED SECTION, AND TRANSFERRING THE FLOW TO THE BYPASS LASTED FROM APPROXIMATELY 8:00 PM ON 1/7/19 UNTIL 11:10 AM ON 1/8/19. REPLACING THE DAMAGED LATERAL CONTAINING THE SECTION OF T-04 WITH PRE-TESTED PIPE AND PLACING THE PIPELINE BACK IN SERVICE TOOK UNTIL 11:10 AM ON 1/8/19. BACKFILLING AND ROAD REPAIR LASTED THROUGH THE EVENING.          OTHER INFORMATION OF NOTE  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND REPAIR PROCESSES REQUIRED THE SHUT-DOWN OF SWANNANOA RIVER ROADS.  THE ENTIRE STOPPAGE OF THE LEAK AND REPAIR WERE WORKED OUTSIDE OF THE HAZARDOUS GASEOUS ENVIRONMENT.  PSNC WORKED WITH LOCAL NEWS TO PUT OUT TRAFFIC ADVISORIES. PSNC ENERGY'S IN HOUSE INSPECTOR WAS DRUG TESTED SINCE HIS ACTIONS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT. THE NCUC HAD PIPELINE SAFETY OFFICERS ON THE SCENE. SCANA GAS SERVICES FACILITATED A HUMAN FACTOR INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT. THE HFI REPORT IS INCOMPLETE AS OF 1/29/19."

CON EDISON'S GERC THEN INITIATED A MULTIPLE RESOURCE RESPONSE EVENT (CODE MURRE) AND DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO THE LOCATION FROM SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS, INCLUDING GDS, LEAK SURVEY, AND ITS GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE GROUP (ERG). AT 14:26, CON EDISON'S GERC IDENTIFIED TWO HIGH-PRESSURE MAIN VALVES (46441 & 15123) FOR ISOLATING THE COMPROMISED 24-INCH STEEL SUPPLY MAIN. AT 14:50, GDS CLOSED MAIN VALVE 46441 BUT WAS UNABLE TO CLOSE MAIN VALVE 15123, WHICH WAS REPORTEDLY INOPERABLE. CON EDISON'S GERC THEN IDENTIFIED A BACK-UP HIGH-PRESSURE MAIN VALVE (21738), WHICH WAS CLOSED BY ON-SITE GDS PERSONNEL AT 15:42, THEREBY ISOLATING THE AFFECTED SUPPLY MAIN AND ELIMINATING THE BLOWING GAS CONDITION. THE INCIDENT RESULTED IN NO SYSTEM IMPACT OR GAS SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS.  CON EDISON RECEIVED A TOTAL OF ONE-HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX (156) RELATED GAS ODOR COMPLAINTS.

TWO ADDITIONS WERE GIVEN IN THE 48 HOUR UPDATE:  THE AMOUNT OF GAS LOST WAS INCORRECTLY REPORTED - CORRECT AMOUNT WAS 5,853 MCF (5,853,000 CUBIC FEET).  THE OTHER UPDATE WAS TO INCLUDE THE CONTRACTOR INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT - M.K. WEEDEN.  THE NRC REPORT NUMBER FOR THIS UPDATE IS INCIDENT REPORT # 1232850.    NO INJURIES, DEATHS, OR EVACUATIONS OCCURRED WITH THIS INCIDENT.  NO LOCATE TICKET WAS SUBMITTED BY THE EXCAVATING PARTY WHEN THIS WORK WAS BEING DONE.      16:26 MST M.K. WEEDEN HIT A 12-INCH STEEL GAS MAIN LOCATED NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF FARRELL AND TEXAS AVE. WITH AN EXCAVATOR.  THE LINE WAS AN INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE LINE OPERATING AT 50 PSIG.    16:45 MST NORTHWESTERN WAS NOTIFIED BY THE CONTRACTOR THAT A NWE GAS LINE WAS HIT NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF FARRELL AND TEXAS AVE.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE WAS NOTIFIED AND NORTHWESTERN ENERGY PERSONNEL WAS DISPATCH TO EVALUATE THE HIT LINE FROM A SAFE DISTANCE.  ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WERE CONTACTED TO ASSIST WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES AND TRAFFIC CONTROL.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL WAS ALSO ONSITE TO ASSIST.    17:00 MST  NORTHWESTERN ENERGY WITH OTHER PERSONNEL CREATED A 360 DEGREE ZONE AROUND THE LOCATION OF THE HIT LINE AND WAS MONITORING THE GAS LEVELS TO CREATE A SAFE ZONE.  CONTINUOUS AIR MONITORING WAS DONE UNTIL THE FLOW OF GAS WAS SHUT DOWN.        17:10 MST  DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE LINE, NORTHWESTERN ENERGY NEEDED FURTHER ASSISTANCE BY OUR GAS TRANSMISSION DEPARTMENT WITH EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS TO MAKE THE REPAIR.    17:30 MST  MORE NWE PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE AND FURTHER EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED TO FINALIZE THE SAFEST AND BEST WAY TO CORRECT THE SITUATION.      03:45 MST  THE FLOW OF GAS WAS SHUT DOWN BY INSERTING STOPPER.  WITH FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE PIPE ONCE SAFE, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DAMAGE BY THE EXCAVATOR BUCKET CREATED TWO PUNCTURES HOLES IN THE PIPE. ONE OF THE PUNCTURES WAS MEASURED AT 3 INCHES BY 2 INCHES.  THE SECOND MEASURED AT 4 INCHES BY 3 INCHES.      8:15 MST  REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 8TH AND PIPE LINE WAS PLACED BACK IN SERVICE."

ADDITIONAL CON EDISON GAS EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WERE THEN DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION. AT 18:17, THE GDS MECHANIC REPORTED THAT AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED INSIDE THE EQUINOX GYM, SHATTERING THE BUILDING'S WINDOWS. THE GERC THEN DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL CON EDISON GAS PERSONNEL TO THE LOCATION TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. AT 18:34, ONSITE GDS PERSONNEL REPORTED HAVING NO ACCESS TO THE CURB VALVE ON THE GAS SERVICE LINE SUPPLYING 2465 BROADWAY DUE TO UNSAFE CONDITIONS IN THE SIDEWALK AREA RELATED TO AN APPARENT UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC CABLE BURNOUT. BY 20:39, CON EDISON PERSONNEL CLOSED THREE LOW-PRESSURE MAIN VALVES TO ISOLATE THE AREA, WHICH INTERRUPTED GAS SERVICE TO NINE BUILDINGS AND 538 CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, CON EDISON ELECTRIC OPERATIONS PERSONNEL DE-ENERGIZED THE ELECTRIC SUPPLY ON THE WEST SIDE OF BROADWAY BETWEEN WEST 91ST AND WEST 92ND STREETS, AND CONFIRMED THAT AN UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC CABLE BURNOUT HAD OCCURRED IN THE AREA IN FRONT OF 2465 BROADWAY.AT 21:47, CON EDISON PERSONNEL REPORTED, PER THE ONSITE FDNY BATTALION CHIEF,THAT A SUSPECTED NATURAL GAS IGNITION HAD OCCURRED INSIDE OF THE EQUINOX GYM. THE FDNY ALSO REPORTED DETECTING 3.5 PERCENT NATURAL GAS-IN-AIR (70 PERCENT OF THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT) INSIDE THE BUILDING'S BASEMENT STAIRCASE PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.CON EDISON GDS PERSONNEL THEN GAINED ACCESS TO THE BUILDING AND DETECTED 0.2 PERCENT NATURAL GAS-IN-AIR AT THE FOUNDATION WALL IN THE BASEMENT IN THE VICINITY OF THE GAS METER, WHICH QUICKLY VENTED TO 0 PERCENT.THE GAS PIPING INSIDE THE BASEMENT AT THE GAS METER WAS FOUND INTACT.  BY 22:45, THE FDNY TERMINATED ALL EVACUATIONS EXCEPT FOR THE AFFECTED BUILDING AT 2465 BROADWAY. THE AREA IS SUPPLIED BY AN 8-INCH AND 6-INCH LOW-PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE (LPPE) GAS MAIN, WITH A 4-INCH LPPE GAS SERVICE SUPPLYING THE BUILDING AT 2465 BROADWAY.CON EDISON CHECKED ODORANT LEVELS AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PRESSURE SUPPLYING THE AREA AFTER THE INCIDENT AND FOUND BOTH TO BE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE RANGES. ON NOVEMBER 26, 2018, AT 10:56, A BASEBALL-SIZED HOLE WAS FOUND IN THE 6-INCH LPPE GAS MAIN IN FRONT OF 2465 BROADWAY. THE HOLE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE ELECTRIC CABLE BURNOUT THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THAT AREA. THE AFFECTED SECTION OF 6-INCH LPPE GAS MAIN WAS CUT OUT AND CAPPED, AND THE THREE CLOSED MAIN VALVES WERE RE-OPENED, RESTORING GAS SUPPLY IN THE AFFECTED AREA.SUBSEQUENT LEAK SURVEYS CONDUCTED IN THE AREA IDENTIFIED TWO GAS LEAK (A TYPE 1 LEAK IN FRONT OF 256 WEST 92ND STREET AND A TYPE 3 LEAK IN FRONT OF 251 WEST 92ND STREET).CON EDISON PINPOINTED AND REPAIRED BOTH LEAKS.

THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS UNKNOWN; INITIAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY VENTURA COUNTY FIRE SUGGESTED POSSIBLE PROPANE INVOLVEMENT.  THERE WERE THREE INJURIES THAT WERE TRANSPORTED TO LOCAL HOSPITAL AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT.  DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT EXCEEDS $50,000.      ALTHOUGH THE GAS METER ASSEMBLY (MSA) DID NOT SUSTAIN DAMAGE FROM THE FIRE, VENTURA COUNTY FIRE REQUESTED THE SERVICE BE ABANDONED DUE TO EXTENSIVE PROPERTY DAMAGE AND THE POTENTIAL OF THE WEAKENED STRUCTURE FALLING ONTO THE MSA.  LATER ON NOVEMBER 24, 2018, ONCE THE AREA AROUND THE INCIDENT WAS SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE, A SOCALGAS CREW BEGAN ABANDONING THE SERVICE.  IN THE PROCESS, THE CREW FOUND A SMALL LEAK AT THE SERVICE-TO-MAIN-CONNECTION (SMC), WHICH IS LOCATED ACROSS THE STREET (CORTEZ STREET).  THE CREW THEN PROCEEDED TO CONDUCT LEAK SURVEY AND BAR HOLE SURVEY OF THE GENERAL AREA.  THROUGH THESE ACTIVITIES, THE CREW LOCATED A SECOND LEAK ON A 2-INCH PLASTIC MAIN INSTALLED UNDER LEMAR AVENUE.  THE CREW ISOLATED APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET OF THE MAIN TO CUT-OFF SUPPLY TO THAT PORTION OF THE MAIN.     ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 2018, PIPELINE SAFETY, COMPLIANCE AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT FROM SOCALGAS BECAME AWARE THAT NATURAL GAS INDICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED NEAR THE INCIDENT.  ALTHOUGH THE INCIDENT REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION AND NO CAUSE HAS BEEN DETERMINED, A PIPELINE SAFETY, COMPLIANCE AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT REPRESENTATIVE NOTIFIED THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE CPUC.  INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS ONGOING.        TENTATIVELY, SOCALGAS IS COORDINATING WITH VARIOUS PARTIES INVOLVED TO CONDUCT A PRESSURE TEST OF THE HOUSELINE ON JANUARY 11, 2019, AND AN INSPECTION OF THE SOCALGAS COMPONENTS ON JANUARY 18, 2019.         FOR ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS, CONTACT KHOA LE AT (626) 893-4536      UPDATE 2/21/19:    ON 1-11-2019, A SITE INSPECTION WAS CONDUCTED AT THE ADDRESS IN QUESTION.  HA NGUYEN FROM CPUC WAS PRESENT.  EXPERTS REPRESENTING THE HOME INSURANCE AND SOCALGAS WERE PRESENT.  A PRESSURE TEST OF THE HOUSELINE WAS CONDUCTED.  DURING THE TEST, A BREACH WAS FOUND NEAR THE WALL FURNACE AT THE HOUSELINE.  A CRACK ON A NIPPLE AND ELBOW OF THE HOUSELINE WAS FOUND.  EXPERTS REMOVED THAT PART OF THE HOUSELINE AND RETESTED THE REMAINING HOUSELINE.  A COUPLE OF OTHER LEAKS WERE FOUND:  ONE AT THE METER SET ASSEMBLY AT A UNION FITTING.  ANOTHER LEAK WAS FOUND AT A LINE VALVE LOCATED IN THE GARAGE.  AFTER THE RETEST OF HOUSELINE TEST, WE DISCUSSED THE NEXT PHASE OF INSPECTING THE MAIN LINE SET FOR 1-18-2019.      ON 1-18-2019, ANOTHER SITE INSPECTION WAS CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE GAS MAIN PIPE.  ESI HOSTED THE SITE INSPECTION IN IRVINE.  ALL EXPERTS WERE PRESENT, INCLUDING DURGA SHRESTHA FROM THE CPUC.  PHOTOS WERE TAKEN BY ALL PARTIES, INCLUDING DIGITALLY MAGNIFIED IMAGES OF THE PIPE SURFACE.  DISCUSSION OF FUTURE TESTING WERE PENDING.      ON 2-14-2019, ANOTHER SITE INSPECTION WAS CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE HOUSE'S CONCRETE FOUNDATION.  ALL EXPERTS WERE PRESENT, INCLUDING HA NGUYEN FROM THE CPUC.  ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL TESTING ON THE PIPE ON 3/26/19; CPUC IS AWARE.      06-05-2019 UPDATE: - THE SECTION OF MAIN WAS INSPECTED ON 3/26/2019 AT A 3RD PARTY LABORATORY (VOLLMER GRAY LABORATORIES IN SIGNAL HILLS, CA). SAMPLE WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED, PRESSURE TESTED AND BEND BACK TESTED.  THE IDENTIFIED LEAK CAUSE WAS EXCESSIVE STRESS, OTHER THAN PRESSURE (POINT LOAD), IN THE VICINITY OF UNDERGROUND TREE ROOTS.  AFTER PERFORMING INVESTIGATIONS, SOCALGAS CONCLUDES THAT THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION IS UNDETERMINED."

THE EXCAVATOR, V ROSE EXCAVATING, LLC, WAS WORKING WITHOUT A VALID MARKOUT TICKET AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.      INCIDENT SUMMARY:  THE PIPE, A 60 PSIG MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE (""MAOP"") HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE (""HDPE"") PERFORMANCE DRISCOPIPE 8000, WAS INSTALLED IN NOVEMBER 1996.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THE PIPE WAS OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 46 PSIG.  THE PIPE RUNS BEHIND EIGHT TOWNHOUSE RESIDENCES WITH ENTRANCES THAT FACE PRIVATE WAY AND 2ND STREET IN LAKEWOOD.  THE MACHINE OPERATOR STRUCK THE PIPE WITH THE TRACKHOE BUCKET COMPLETELY SEVERING IT CIRCUMFERENTIALLY.  UPON STRIKING THE PIPE, THE MACHINE OPERATOR LEFT THE TRACKHOE RUNNING AND FLED THE SCENE.  THE ESCAPING NATURAL GAS IGNITED APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES AFTER THE PIPE WAS DAMAGED BY THE EXCAVATOR.    NJNG RECEIVED AN INITIAL CALL FROM THE EXCAVATION COMPANY'S OWNER, VICTOR ROSE, AT 8:04 A.M. ON NOVEMBER 12, 2018 REPORTING DAMAGE TO A NATURAL GAS FACILITY.  NJNG DISPATCHED PERSONNEL AT 8:09 A.M. WHO ARRIVED ON-SITE AT 8:22 A.M.

DAMAGE:  THREE TOWNHOMES SUSTAINED FIRE DAMAGE:  I) 527 2ND STREET; II) 525 2ND STREET; AND III) 207 PRIVATE WAY.  THE DAMAGE INCLUDES BURNS TO THE STRUCTURE, SIDING, DECKS, INTERIOR DAMAGE AND OTHER SMOKE AND/OR WATER DAMAGE WHICH AT THIS TIME IS EXPECTED TO TOTAL MORE THAN $50,000.00.  THE TRACKHOE SUSTAINED SOME SCORCHING DAMAGE BUT WAS CAPABLE OF DRIVING OFF THE PROPERTY AFTER THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE.  THERE WERE NO FATALITIES OR INJURIES REQUIRING IN-PATIENT HOSPITALIZATION.    RESTORATION OF GAS SERVICE:  IN ORDER TO RESTORE GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED DISTRIBUTION MAIN AND SERVICES FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, APPROXIMATELY FIVE FEET OF NEW 2"" HDPE MAIN WAS INSTALLED TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED MAIN.  THE REPAIRED GAS MAIN WAS PUT BACK INTO SERVICE AT 5:30 P.M. ON NOVEMBER 12, 2018.  AN UNDISTURBED PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED MAIN WAS MEASURED AT A DEPTH OF 3 FEET 6 INCHES.  FOUR OF THE EIGHT AFFECTED METERS HAD THE GAS SERVICE RESTORED AFTER REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED.  THE GAS SERVICE LINE TO 527 2ND STREET WAS RETIRED.  GAS SERVICE WAS LEFT OFF TO THREE METERS AT END OF DAY. ONE OF THE THREE METERS HAS SINCE BEEN TURNED BACK ON. METERS AT 527 2ND STREET AND 207 PRIVATE WAY REMAIN OFF DUE TO THE FIRE DAMAGE TO THE STRUCTURES."

THERE APPEARED TO BE EXTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE 1"" COUPLING AND THE 1"" CTS PIPING APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN LOWERED IN PLACE BY THE HOME BUILDER.    THE 1"" CTS PIPING WAS A DEAD END SERVICE STUB AND WAS UNKNOWINGLY OPERATING AT 230 PSI DUE TO A PREVIOUS UPRATE OF A 10"" STEEL PIPELINE.    THE 1"" CTS, SDR 11.5, ALDYL-A PIPE AND 1"" SOCKET FUSION COUPLING WERE SUBJECT TO A SHOCKWAVE CREATED BY THE HOME EXPLOSION.    THE 1"" CTS, SDR 11.5, ALDYL-A PIPE AND 1"" SOCKET FUSION COUPLING IS BEING SENT TO AN INDEPENDENT LAB FOR A FORENSIC INVESTIGATION AND TESTING.    4/12/2019:  LAB TESTING RESULTS WERE RECEIVED FROM TWO THIRD PARTY CONSULTANTS.  RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE 1"" COUPLING FAILED DUE TO SLOW CRACK GROWTH PROPAGATION AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE STRESSES BEING APPLIED TO THE FITTING.  PER THE REPORTS, THE CRACK GROWTH AND LEAK POINT ON THE COUPLING WAS CONSISTENT WITH A TENSILE LOAD ON THE COUPLING.  THE PHENOMENA OF A BRITTLE CRACK WHICH STARTS IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE HEAT FUSION JOINED TUBING TERMINATES ON THE INTERIOR OF A SOCKET FUSION HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED PREVIOUSLY IN INDUSTRY.  THE CRACK FORMED BY THE NOTCH GEOMETRY CREATED BY THE INSERTED TUBING AND ITS POINT OF HEAT FUSION JOINING TO THE SOCKET WHICH, WHEN UNDER GAS PRESSURE, CAN CREATE A STRESS RISER.  THE NOTCH GEOMETRY MAY HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTED BY THE SOCKET FUSION TOOLS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION.  THE FAILURE IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE OF ALDYL-A PIPE AND FITTINGS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO 1984 AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INNER WALL CRACKING.  THE COUPLING WAS 10"" UNDER THE FOUNDATION OF THE GARAGE AND APPEARED TO BE LOWERED IN PLACE DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STRUCTURE.  LOWERING WOULD HAVE CAUSED TENSILE STRESS ON THE PIPE AND COUPLING.  NO EXTERNAL DAMAGES WERE SEEN ON THE PIPE OR COUPLING FROM CONSTRUCTION OF THE GARAGE STRUCTURE.  AGAIN PER THE REPORTS, THE INTERNAL PRESSURE IN THE PIPE MAY HAVE ACCELERATED THE FAILURE IN THE COUPLING BUT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED AS THE SOLE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE.  THE TIME TO FAILURE FROM CRACKING COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED OR DETERMINED IN EITHER REPORT.    11/19/2019 - SUBMITTED AS FINAL REPORT WITHOUT FURTHER CHANGES AT THIS TIME."

FURTHER RESTORATION CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AS PREMISES WERE MADE SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE.      UPON INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A THIRD PARTY EXCAVATOR INSTALLING TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES WITH HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING EQUIPMENT HAD DAMAGED A 2"" PE GAS MAIN.  THE DAMAGED MAIN RELEASED GAS WHICH MIGRATED BELOW GRADE, INTO NEARBY BUILDINGS, AND  WAS IGNITED BY AN UNKNOWN SOURCE.  ONE-CALL CENTER RECORDS DO NOT INDICATE THAT THE THIRD PARTY EXCAVATOR HAD MADE A REQUEST TO LOCATE BURIED FACILITIES IN THE BORING PATH PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONALLY, AT THE DAMAGED GAS LINE LOCATION, FACILITIES HAD NOT BEEN EXPOSED BY THE EXCAVATOR TO ENSURE THAT PROPER CLEARANCES WERE MAINTAINED BETWEEN THE BORING EQUIPMENT AND WE ENERGIES FACILITIES."

AT 20:25 NV ENERGY (NVE) WAS CONTACTED BY THE CITY OF RENO PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCH NOTIFYING OF A ""WORKING FIRE"" AT 624 EUREKA AVENUE IN RENO, NEVADA.  NVE GAS DISPATCH SENDS GAS SERVICEMEN TO INVESTIGATE.  AT 20:51 THE CITY OF RENO PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCH CONTACTED NVE AGAIN TO REPORT THAT THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION AT THIS LOCATION, POSSIBLY FROM THE FURNACE.      AT 21:02 THE FIRST NVE PERSONNEL ARRIVE AT THE SITE AND FOUND THE HOME AT 624 EUREKA AVE DAMAGED BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GAS EXPLOSION WITH INDICATIONS OF UNDERGROUND GAS READINGS.  RENO FIRE DEPARTMENT AND NVE PERSONNEL EVACUATE THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND MONITOR GAS CONCENTRATIONS WHILE OTHER NVE PERSONNEL EXPOSE THE SERVICE TEE AND SECURE THE GAS LEAK.      THE LEAK OCCURRED AT THE THREADED JOINT BETWEEN A 3/4"" BLACK IRON PIPE NIPPLE AND A 3/4"" BLACK IRON 90 DEGREE ELBOW AT THE SERVICE TEE CONNECTION TO 614 EUREKA AVENUE.  BASED UPON THE RENO FIRE DEPARTMENT INCIDENT REPORT, NATURAL GAS LEAKING FROM THE SERVICE TEE APPEARS TO HAVE TRAVELED THROUGH A SERVICE TRENCH INTO THE BASEMENT OF 624 EUREKA.  THE LEAKING GAS WAS IGNITED IN THE BASEMENT BY THE FURNACE, EXPLODED, AND DAMAGED THE HOME.  TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE IN THE RESIDENCE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION BUT NO INJURIES WERE SUSTAINED.  THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE CAUSE IS DETERMINED.     AT 22:36 THE NVE DUTY SUPERVISOR ON SCENE DETERMINED THAT THE PROPERTY DAMAGE COSTS WOULD EXCEED $50,000.  THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS MADE AT 22:49 AND WAS GIVEN NRC INCIDENT REPORT # 1207485.  NVE PROVIDED AN UPDATE TO THE NRC ON MARCH 23, 2018 AT 15:44 AND WAS GIVEN NRC INCIDENT REPORT # 1207546.    SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE:  FURTHER ANALYSIS HAS DETERMINED THAT THE PIPE-TO-ELBOW JOINT FAILED DUE TO OVERLOAD FROM AN EXTERNAL BENDING LOAD AND NOT DUE TO A MATERIAL OR MANUFACTURING DEFECT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PIPES OR FITTINGS.  THE EXTERNAL BENDING LOAD AT THE FAILED PIPE-TO-ELBOW JOINT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF LOADING IMPARTED TO THIS JOINT DURING COMPACTION AROUND THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION.  NV ENERGY'S CONTRACTOR WAS PERFORMING BACKFILL AND COMPACTION ACTIVITIES ON THIS TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION ONE DAY PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT OCCURRING.       FINAL UPDATE:  ANALYSIS HAS CONCLUDED AND THE INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY A LEAK FROM A CRACK IN THE BLACK IRON PIPE USED FOR THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION FOR THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY 614 EUREKA AVENUE. THE GAS MIGRATED INTO THE BASEMENT OF THE INCIDENT HOUSE WHERE IT FOUND AN IGNITION SOURCE, MOST LIKELY THE HOUSE FURNACE. THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE CRACK IN THE PIPE WAS MECHANICAL OVERLOADING OF THE HORIZONTAL SECTION OF THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION.  THE MECHANICAL OVERLOADING WAS LIKELY CAUSED DURING COMPACTION OF SAND AROUND THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION, DUE TO INSUFFICIENT COVER (SAND ABOVE THE PIPE) DURING COMPACTION."

COLUMBIA'S SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED AT 12:42 AM AND ARRIVED ON SITE AT 01:15 AM AND FOUND THAT GAS HAD BEEN SHUT OFF AT THE METER VALVE BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. ADDITIONAL COLUMBIA RESOURCES ARRIVED ON SITE AT 1:50 AM TO ASSIST IN THE RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT. COLUMBIA EMPLOYEES SET UP A PERIMETER AND EVACUATED THE NEIGHBORING HOME AT 605 FLEMING FALLS WHERE NATURAL GAS READINGS WERE DISCOVERED IN THE BASEMENT. COLUMBIA VERIFIED THAT THE SYSTEM PRESSURE WAS WITHIN THE MAOP ESTABLISHED FOR THAT SYSTEM AND THAT ODORANT WAS COMPLIANT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. ELECTRIC METERS WERE REMOVED TO ELIMINATE SOURCES OF IGNITION AND COLUMBIA BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR LEAKAGE AND ENSURE SAFETY.    THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RAIN  THAT CAUSED THE SANITARY LIFT PUMPS TO FAIL  AND MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY PUSHED A SLUG OF SEWER GAS  INTO THE BASEMENT VIA FLOOR DRAINS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE TIED DIRECTLY TO THE SANITARY SEWER FOR 605 AND 613 FLEMING FALLS RD. THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED APPEARS TO BE A LOW LEVEL EXPLOSION. COLUMBIA LOCATED AND REPAIRED A TOTAL OF FOUR LEAKS OF WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE NON-CAUSAL. THE CLOSEST BEING APPROXIMATELY 290' AWAY AND THE FURTHEST BEING APPROXIMATELY 1300' AWAY FROM THE INCIDENT. THE SURFACE LEVEL OF THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET IS APPROXIMATELY 12'  LOWER THAN THE SURFACE LEVEL OF THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE INCIDENT SITE.  COLUMBIA CREATED A TEMPORARY BYPASS TO KEEP CUSTOMERS IN SERVICE, ABANDONING APPROXIMATELY 775' OF BARE STEEL HIGH PRESSURE MAINLINE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET.    COLUMBIA PRESSURE TESTED THE BARE STEEL MAIN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET ALONG WITH THE SERVICES (WITH NO DROP IN PRESSURE AT 76 PSIG) AND RAN A CAMERA INSIDE THEM TO ENSURE ALL SERVICE TEES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AND TO LOOK FOR ANOMALIES. COLUMBIA TESTED APPROXIMATELY 448' OF HIGH DENSITY POLY ETHYLENE (HDPE) MAIN LINE AND 6 SERVICES ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STREET AND IT SUCCESSFULLY PASSED SEVERAL PRESSURE TESTS AT 76 PSIG (OPERATING PRESSURE), 15 INCHES WATER COLUMN AND 150 PSIG. IN ADDITION COLUMBIA TESTED APPROXIMATELY 1,175' OF HDPE MAIN LINE AND SERVICE ON THE STREET BEHIND INCIDENT SITE. AT 613 FLEMING FALLS RD., COLUMBIA PRESSURE TESTED THE SERVICE LINE AND CHECKED THE SERVICE REGULATOR FOR LOCK UP AND FLOW WITHOUT ISSUE AND NO LEAKAGE DETECTED. THE SERVICE LINE AT THE NEIGHBORING HOME (637  FLEMING FALLS RD) WAS ALSO TESTED AND FOUND TO BE LEAK FREE.

COLUMBIA ALSO RAN A CAMERA IN THE SANITARY MAIN AND SEWER LATERALS TO ENSURE THAT A CROSS BORE DID NOT EXIST. UN-COLLAPSED STORM SEWERS WERE VIDEOED AS WELL TO ENSURE A CROSS BORE DID NOT EXIST.     COLUMBIA WORKED WITH THE PUCO, STATE FIRE MARSHALL, A THIRD-PARTY CAUSE AND ORIGIN SPECIALIST, AND A GEOLOGIST TO DETERMINE A CAUSE. LABORATORY GAS ANALYSES AND OUR GEOLOGIST'S INTERPRETATION INDICATE THAT THE STRAY GAS SAMPLES HAD A COMPARABLE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION AND MOLECULAR PROFILE, AND IS SIMILAR IN ORIGIN TO COLUMBIA'S PIPELINE GAS, HOWEVER, NATURALLY OCCURRING METHANE CONTAINING SIMILAR MOLECULAR AND ISOTOPIC PROFILE CANNOT BE COMPLETELY RULED OUT AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE. THE GEOLOGIST THEORIZES THAT GROUND WATER, IN COMBINATION WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF RAIN WATER, LIKELY CREATED CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR GAS MIGRATION TOWARD THE STRUCTURES AT 605 AND 613 FLEMING FALLS RD.     COLUMBIA HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT CANNOT BE FULLY ASCERTAINED. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS REPORT A FINAL REPORT.    NOTE: UPDATED LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE 9-21-18"

MULTIPLE 911 CALLS CAME INTO THE DALLAS FIRE-RESCUE DISPATCH CENTER REPORTING THE EXPLOSION.  FIVE FAMILY MEMBERS WERE IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  ONE RESIDENT'S INJURIES WERE FATAL. THE OTHER FOUR RESIDENTS SUSTAINED NON-LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.    AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, ATMOS PERSONNEL WERE IN THE AREA WORKING TO REPAIR A NON-HAZARDOUS LEAK IN THE 3500 BLOCK OF ESPANOLA. AN ATMOS OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR HEARD THE EXPLOSION AND TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PROTECT LIVES AND MAKE THE AREA SAFE.  HE DIRECTED HIS CREW TO START EVACUATING A TWO-BLOCK AREA, NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ACCIDENT HOUSE.  FIREFIGHTERS AND ATMOS CREWS WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR ADVISING RESIDENTS TO EVACUATE AND TO REFRAIN FROM STARTING CARS OR SWITCHING ON LIGHTS.  THE EVACUATION WAS COMPLETED IN 12-15 MINUTES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF DALLAS FIRE-RESCUE.  THE ATMOS ONSITE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR, WORKING WITH THE OPERATIONS MANAGER AND THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS, COORDINATED THE SHUT-DOWN OF THE MAIN LINE IN THE ALLEY BEHIND 3534 ESPANOLA.     THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) ARRIVED ONSITE ON 2/25/2018. ATMOS ENERGY, THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION (RRC), PIPELINE & HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (PHMSA), AND DALLAS FIRE - RESCUE ASSISTED WITH THE NTSB'S INVESTIGATION.       THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AT 3534 ESPANOLA DRIVE WAS THE IGNITION OF AN ACCUMULATION OF NATURAL GAS THAT LEAKED FROM THE GAS MAIN THAT WAS DAMAGED DURING A SEWER REPLACEMENT PROJECT 23 YEARS EARLIER.  POST-ACCIDENT EXCAVATION CONFIRMED THE 2"" MAIN WAS CRACKED IN THE AREA IT HAD BEEN GOUGED, BENT, AND DENTED BY MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT.  THE THIRD-PARTY DAMAGE WAS NEVER REPORTED TO ATMOS."

AT APPROXIMATELY AT 8:45 P.M. (CST), THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS CUT AND CAPPED THE THREE-QUARTER INCH (3/4"") P.E. SERVICE LINE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY (30) FEET FROM THE HOUSE.  A REMOTE METHANE LEAK DETECTION SURVEY WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS.  THE SURVEY DETECTED A SLIGHT READING WHICH DISSIPATED FOLLOWING THE CAPPING OF THE SERVICE LINE.  BEFORE THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS LEFT THE SCENE THEY REMOVED THE GAS METER AND REGULATOR WHICH WERE DAMAGED BEYOND USE IN THIS INCIDENT.  MTNGUD TECHNICIANS DID NOT INVESTIGATE ANY PIPE DOWNSTREAM OF THE GAS METER.    ON JANUARY 9, 2018, MTNGUD PERSONNEL CONDUCTED AN ODORANT TEST NEAR THE INCIDENT SITE.  THE ODORANT WAS IN AN ACCEPTABLE RANGE.      ON JANUARY 11, 2018, AN AIR TEST ON THE SERVICE LINE INDICATED A FAILURE OF THE SERVICE LINE.  EXCAVATION UNDER A CONCRETE SLAB LED TO DISCOVERY OF A SERVICE LINE REPAIR BY USE OF A COMPRESSION COUPLING.  THIS REPAIR LOCATION WAS DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH A FOUR-INCH PVC DRAIN PIPE.  ONE END OF THE SERVICE LINE WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE COUPLING.  IT IS UNKNOWN IF THIS DISCONNECTION OCCURRED BEFORE OR DURING THE EXPLOSION.    FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED TWO (2) ADDITIONAL DAMAGED AREAS ON THE SERVICE LINE.  IN 2006, AN EXCAVATOR HIT AND CUT THE LINE.  THIS DAMAGE HAD BEEN REPAIRED BY USE OF A STAB FITTING.  THIS REPAIR WAS INTACT.  THE SIGHT OF A CROSSING OF THE SERVICE LINE WITH A CABLE TV LINE REVEALED THAT THE SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN STRUCK AND PULLED WITH FORCE LEAVING MARKS AND DISTORTION ON THE LINE.  THE LINE REMAINED SERVICEABLE AT THIS DAMAGE LOCATION.  AN MTNGUD SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS ONSITE AT THIS METER ON 12/5/17 FOR A REGULAR ANNUAL PRESSURE CONFIRMATION AND THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF IRREGULARITIES OR ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS AT THAT TIME.    WEATHER IN CROSSVILLE, TENNESSEE, PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT WAS UNUSUALLY COLD WITH FREEZING AND THAWING OF THE GROUND IN THE VICINITY, WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COUPLING TO SERVICE LINE FAILURE.  PREVIOUS EXCAVATION DAMAGE MAY ALSO HAVE COMPROMISED THE INTEGRITY OF THIS CONNECTION.  THE SEPARATION OF THE COUPLING FROM THE SERVICE LINE WAS SO COMPLETE, IT RAISES ISSUES OF THE TIME AND CAUSE OF THE SEPARATION."

PNM IS THE LOCAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND WAS THE EXCAVATOR ON SITE.  ZIA PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 9:16AM AND ASSESSED THE SITUATION.  A 16' CORE BARREL AUGER UTILIZED TO DRILL A HOLE FOR A POWER POLE HAD STRUCK A 2' PE DISTRIBUTION GAS MAIN APPROXIMATELY 53' DEEP.  AT THE TIME OF THE HIT, PNM HAD IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE AUGER EQUIPMENT AND LEFT IT IN PLACE.  THE GAS MAIN HAD A TWO-WAY SUPPLY AT THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGE.  ZIA PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT THE BUILDING AT 641 SUDDERTH DR. WAS VACANT.  ZIA PERSONNEL EXCAVATED THE MAIN ON EACH SIDE OF THE DAMAGE TO SQUEEZE OFF THE LINE AND SHUT OFF THE FLOW OF GAS.   BETWEEN 9:45AM AND 9:55AM, ZIA PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO EXCAVATE THE MAIN ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE DAMAGE AND INSTALL SQUEEZE OFF EQUIPMENT.  AT APPROXIMATELY 9:55AM, ZIA PERSONNEL REQUESTED A MECHANICAL EXCAVATOR TO ASSIST WITH EXCAVATING THE MAIN ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE DAMAGE DUE TO MULTIPLE LAYER OF ASPHALT AND GRAVEL.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:41AM, ZIA PERSONNEL REQUESTED TRAFFIC CONTROL ASSISTANCE FROM LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WHICH ARRIVED AT 10:45AM.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:05AM, AN EXPLOSION AT 641 SUDDERTH DR OCCURRED.  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION, THE AREA WAS EVACUATED.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:20AM, THE MAIN WAS MECHANICALLY SQUEEZED SHUT AND THE FLOW OF GAS WAS STOPPED.  POST-INCIDENT, ZIA PERSONNEL PERFORMED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE AREA AND CHECKED SYSTEM PRESSURE TO VERIFY NO ADDITIONAL ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS.  THE DAMAGE TO THE GAS MAIN WAS REPAIRED ON DECEMBER 28, 2017 AND FLOW WAS RE-ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE MAIN.    AN INVESTIGATION OF THE EXCAVATION DAMAGE REVEALED THAT THE MOST RECENT LINE LOCATE TICKET, 17NV270924, HAD EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 13, 2017.  THE MARKS WERE STILL VISIBLE ON THE GROUND AND WERE ACCURATE.  PNM HAD EXPOSED AN ABANDONED STEEL LINE WITH YELLOW COATING APPROXIMATELY 12' AWAY FROM THE ACTIVE 2' PE GAS LINE.   ZIA DETERMINED THAT PNM VIOLATED NMAC 18.60.5.15 (B)(2), FAILURE TO MAINTAIN 18' CLEARANCE WITH MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT FROM MARKED FACILITIES, AND NMAC 18.60.5.10, EXCAVATOR SHALL MAKE A LOCATE REQUEST PRIOR TO EXCAVATION."

PGW RESPONDED TO INVESTIGATE THE AREA AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS A RUSTED OUT STEEL SERVICE PIPE IN THE FOOTWAY. PGW DISCONNECTED THE SERVICE ADJACENT TO THE MAIN CONNECTION AND INSERTED PLASTIC TO THE FRONT WALL OF THE PROPERTY IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE LEAK AND RESTORE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER.  THE SERVICE CONNECTION TO THE MAIN WAS A STEEL NIPPLE COMING OFF THE SIDE OF A 6' LOW PRESSURE STEEL MAIN. THIS MAIN CONNECTION REQUIRED THE SERVICES OF A WELDER IN ORDER TO BE PERMANENTLY ABANDONED AND REPLACED WITH A NEW SERVICE TEE.  THE STEEL SERVICE CONNECTION WAS TEMPORARILY WRAPPED WITH WAX-TAPE AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE AND LEFT OVERNIGHT UNTIL A WELDER WAS AVAILABLE.     ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12TH, 2017, PGW DISPATCHED A MAINTENANCE CREW AND WELDER TO THE SITE TO ABANDON THE STEEL NIPPLE SERVICE CONNECTION AND INSTALL A NEW SERVICE TEE. BETWEEN 09:30 AND 11:00, THE CREW WORKED TO CONTINUE PREPARATION OF THE EXCAVATION AND MAIN FOR THE WELDER TO PERMANENTLY ABANDON THE SERVICE CONNECTION.  BETWEEN 11:00 AND 11:23, THE WELDER BEGAN HIS WORK BY CUTTING OFF THE STEEL NIPPLE SERVICE CONNECTION FLUSH WITH THE MAIN. HE PROCEEDED TO USE A SELF-TAPPING TAPERED SCREW PLUG TO ATTEMPT TO SEAL THE OPENING IN THE MAIN.  THE WELDER ATTEMPTED TO WELD THE PLUG SHUT AND IGNITED A SMALL AMOUNT OF GAS WHICH HE WAS UNAWARE WAS BYPASSING.  THE WELDER THEN ATTEMPTED TO ADJUST THE PLUG WITH A PIPE WRENCH INSTEAD OF EXTINGUISHING THE FLAME.  DURING THIS PROCESS, THE PLUG EVACUATED THE OPENING IN THE MAIN AND ALLOWED THE GAS FROM THE MAIN TO ESCAPE AND MAKE CONTACT WITH THE PREVIOUSLY IGNITED FLAME. WHILE HIS FR CLOTHING AND SAFETY GLASSES PROTECTED HIS UPPER TORSO AND EYES, THE PGW WELDER SUSTAINED BURNS TO HIS FACE AND NECK AND WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BY THE PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT.

THE INCIDENT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH 191.15. UPON SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO TRANSMISSION LINES FAILED DURING THIS INCIDENT AND AS SUCH, IT SHOULD BE REPORTED A GAS DISTRIBUTION INCIDENT REPORT.     SUMMARY:  IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF OCTOBER 9, 2017, MULTIPLE WILDFIRES WERE REPORTED AS PART OF THE OCTOBER 2017 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. PG&E FIRST RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE GAS PIPELINE INVOLVEMENT AT 0729 HOURS WHEN IT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF GAS IGNITIONS NEAR 8537 AND 8531 SONOMA HIGHWAY IN THE CITY OF KENWOOD, SONOMA COUNTY.  PG&E'S GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (GSR) ARRIVED ON-SITE AT 0810 HOURS AND OBSERVED GAS HAD IGNITED FROM THE RISER AFTER THE METER HAD MELTED AWAY. THIS SERVICE RISER IS FED FROM A HIGH PRESSURE REGULATOR (HPR) OFF OF DISTRIBUTION FEEDER MAIN (DFM) 1305-01, WHICH IS FED FROM TRANSMISSION LINE L-21 LINE SERIES. ON 10/9/17 AT 1011 HOURS THIS GAS RELEASE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE DOT (1192712) AND CPUC (171009-8550). PER 191.5(C), PG&E PROVIDED AN UPDATE TO THE DOT (1192859) ON 10/10/17.    FOLLOWING THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION DESCRIBED ABOVE, PG&E RECEIVED OTHER REPORTS OF HPRS AND CUSTOMER METER SETS/RISERS IN MULTIPLE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LOCATIONS AFFECTED BY THE WILDFIRES. IN RESPONSE, PG&E ACTIVATED THE LOCAL OEC, GEC AND EOC PER THE COMPANY'S GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN. PG&E CREWS WERE DEPLOYED TO ASSESS, MAKE-SAFE, AND IF POSSIBLE, REPAIR GAS FACILITIES. ON 10/9/17, AT 2011 HOURS, L-21E WAS ISOLATED AND GAS WAS VENTED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE GAS RELEASES MET THE CRITERIA OF A REPORTABLE INCIDENT UNDER BOTH THE DOT CRITERIA OF RELEASE OF GAS WITH PROPERTY DAMAGE IN EXCESS OF $50,000, AS WELL AS THE CPUC CRITERIA OF BOTH PROPERTY DAMAGE AND HAVING ATTRACTED PUBLIC ATTENTION. THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF INJURIES OR FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PG&E GAS FACILITIES. IN TOTAL, APPROXIMATELY 42,500 GAS CUSTOMERS WERE ISOLATED IN THE AREAS IMPACTED BY THE OCTOBER 2017 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES.    ON 10/12/17, AT 1700 HOURS, L-21E WAS RESTORED. BY 10/19/17, ALL AFFECTED CUSTOMERS WHOSE PROPERTY COULD ACCEPT GAS SERVICE WERE RESTORED OR HAD RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE ATTEMPTED RELIGHT.  ESTIMATED DAMAGE COST CALCULATIONS ARE ONGOING DUE TO THE LARGE SCALE NATURE OF THE WILDFIRES AND TOTAL COMPANY COSTS ARE NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME. THE NUMBERS PROVIDED HEREIN ARE FOR ESTIMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE THE BEST ESTIMATE AT THE TIME OF COMPLETING THIS REPORT.    NOTE: THE DATA FIELDS (SERVICE ADDRESS, PIPE VINTAGE, SIZE, MATERIAL, ETC.) IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT REFER TO THE GAS ASSETS AT THE LOCATION OF THE FIRST REPORTED GAS-RELATED"

ACTUAL INCIDENT ADDRESS IS 560 NE 36TH ST., BOCA RATON, FL. AN ENERGIZED PRIMARY POWER LINE FELL FROM A POLE IN A REAR UTILITY EASEMENT STRIKING A METAL STORAGE SHED AND A METAL GUY WIRE FOR THE POLE THAT WAS ANCHORED IN THE GROUND. THE CURRENT FROM THE DOWNED POWER LINE ARCED A HOLE IN A 1.25"" PE GAS MAIN THAT WAS IN THE GROUND NEAR THE GUY WIRE ANCHOR CAUSING A HOLE AND IGNITED THE ESCAPING NATURAL GAS. THE RESULTING FIRE FROM THE STORAGE SHED AND THE GAS MAIN SCORCHED THE ROOF AND WALL OF A NEARBY HOUSE THAT WAS 5' AWAY FROM THE SHED.   OPERATOR CREWS DUG UP AND SQUEEZED OFF THE PE GAS MAIN STOPPING THE FLOW OF GAS AND EXTINGUISHING THE FLAMES.  HURRICANE IRMA HAD PASSED NEAR THE AREA TWO DAYS EARLIER ON SEPTEMBER 10TH, RESULTING IN MANY POWER LINES BEING DAMAGED.   DAMAGE ESTIMATES ARE PRELIMINARY AND MAY BE HIGHER THAN ACTUAL COSTS TO REPAIR AT THIS TIME. A SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN MORE DETAILS ARE KNOWN.  SUPPLEMENTAL - DUE TO ERROR ENTERING INCIDENT ADDRESS ON ORIGINAL REPORT.    11/15/17 - SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORT - PART A (13B) PIPELINE RESTARTED AT 15:00 ON 9/15/17. PART C (5) CHANGED TO LEAK AND PINHOLE. PART D (2) ESTIMATED COST REVISED DUE TO MAJORITY OF DAMAGE ALREADY CAUSED BY PREVIOUS ELECTRICAL INCIDENT 2 DAYS PRIOR. PART G(4) CHANGED TO OTHER.    NEW REPORTS FROM BOCA RATON FIRE DEPARTMENT SHOW THAT TWO (2) INCIDENTS OCCURRED AT THIS RESIDENCE. INCIDENT #1 WAS ELECTRICAL IN NATURE WHEN THE ELECTRICAL SERVICE DROPPED ONTO THE ROOF OF THE STRUCTURE IGNITING A CANVAS AWNING AND ARCING IN THE ROOF AND EAVES OF THE STRUCTURE AND CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE STRUCTURE ON 9/10/17 AT 09:00 HOURS. FIRE DEPARTMENT DAMAGE ESTIMATES OF $40,000 FOR THE STRUCTURE AND $5000 FOR THE CONTENTS. NATURAL GAS WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT OR THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE STRUCTURE.    INCIDENT #2, IN WHICH THE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE WAS INVOLVED, OCCURRED ON 9/12/17 AROUND 15:11 HOURS. THIS INCIDENT RESULTED FROM A DOWNED PRIMARY POWER LINE THAT DROPPED FROM A POWER POLE ONTO A METAL GUY WIRE ANCHORED IN THE GROUND IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE NATURAL GAS MAIN IN A UTILITY EASEMENT AND ONTO A METAL SHED NEAR THE GAS MAIN. THE METAL SHED CONTAINED FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS AND MATERIAL AND IGNITED ALONG WITH ESCAPING NATURAL GAS FROM THE LINE DAMAGED BY THE DOWNED ELECTRICAL PRIMARY LINE. FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTS PUT DAMAGE TO THE SHED AT $1000 AND CONTENTS AT $5000. THERE WAS ADDITIONAL SCORCHING DAMAGE TO THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE SHED. WE REVISE OUR ESTIMATE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE TO $10,000."

[REFERENCE TO FIGURE REMOVED]  AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION, TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE KILLED AND NINE WERE INJURED. AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, TWO WORKERS WERE INSTALLING NEW PIPING TO SUPPORT THE RELOCATION OF GAS METERS FROM THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING TO THE OUTSIDE. TWO NEW METERS MOUNTED ON A WALL WERE READY FOR THE NEW PIPING TO BE CONNECTED. WHILE WORKERS WERE REMOVING THE EXISTING PIPING, A FULL-FLOW NATURAL GAS LINE AT PRESSURE WAS OPENED. THE WORKERS WERE UNABLE TO MITIGATE THE RELEASE OF THE GAS, SO THEY EVACUATED THE AREA. HTTPS://WWW.NTSB.GOV/INVESTIGATIONS/ACCIDENTREPORTS/PAGES/DCA17MP007-PRELIM-REPORT.ASPX     FINAL UPDATE AS OF 1/21/2020    ON DECEMBER 4, 2019, THE NTSB RELEASED THE PUBLIC DOCKET FOR ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT.  AS DESCRIBED IN THE DOCUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE PUBLIC DOCKET, THE NTSB FOUND THAT THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS AT MINNEHAHA ACADEMY OCCURRED WHEN MASTER MECHANICAL DISASSEMBLED EXISTING PIPING IN THE ACADEMY'S BOILER ROOM.  THE MASTER MECHANICAL PERSONNEL BELIEVED A 3-INCH WALWORTH PLUG VALVE UPSTREAM OF THE DISASSEMBLED EXISTING PIPING WAS IN THE CLOSED POSITION ON THE DAY OF THE EXPLOSION, WHEN IN FACT IT WAS OPEN.  THE NTSB ALSO PERFORMED A POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE TAKEN FROM THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION AND FOUND THAT INDICATORS ON THE 3-INCH WALWORTH PLUG VALVE CONFIRMED THAT THE VALVE'S ORIENTATION WAS IN THE OPEN POSITION.  THE NTSB ALSO NOTED THAT ""CONFIRMATION OF WHETHER THE VALVE IS OPEN OR CLOSED IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CREW WORKING ON THE PIPING.  THIS CONFIRMATION WOULD ENTAIL REMOVAL OF THE HANDLE AND NOTING THE POSITION OF THE PLUG ASSEMBLY.""  THE MASTER MECHANICAL PERSONNEL DID NOT PERFORM EITHER OF THESE FUNCTIONS TO CONFIRM THE ORIENTATION OF THE VALVE ON THE DAY OF THE EXPLOSION. AS NOTED IN PARD D 2A OF THIS REPORT, THE EXPLOSION CAUSED AN ESTIMATED $48 MILLION IN ""PROPERTY DAMAGE"" (AS DEFINED IN PHMSA F7100.1) TO THE SCHOOL. THIS FIGURE IS BASED ON ESTIMATES FROM THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL'S PROPERTY INSURER.    IN ITS DECEMBER 6, 2019 ACCIDENT BRIEF, THE NTSB STATED THAT ""THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE NATURAL GAS EXPLOSION AT THE MINNEHAHA ACADEMY WAS THE DISASSEMBLING OF PIPING UPSTREAM OF A GAS SERVICE METER IN THE BUILDING BY A PIPEFITTING CREW [MASTER MECHANICAL], RESULTING IN THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY IGNITED.  CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE LACK OF DETAILED DOCUMENTATION THAT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THE SCOPE OF WORK TO BE PERFORMED."""

CASCADE NATURAL GAS RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND FOUND THE SYSTEM PRESSURE ELEVATED AND THE RELIEF VALVE RELIEVING GAS TO THE ATMOSPHERE.  IT WAS DETERMINED ON THE SCENE THAT THE R18 OPERATING REGULATOR FAILED TO LOCK UP DUE TO EXCESSIVE METAL SHAVINGS IN THE DIAPHRAGM.  WHILE INVESTIGATING THE INCIDENT, A REVIEW OF THE PRESSURE INFORMATION FOR THE SYSTEM INDICATED THAT THE SYSTEM PRESSURE HAS BEEN ELEVATED BEGINNING MID-DAY 05/08/17 AND CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY UNTIL R18 WAS REMEDIATED ON 05/11/17. IT WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED THAT A TAP HAD BEEN PERFORMED ON AN EXISTING PIPELINE JUST UPSTREAM OF THE R18 REGULATOR STATION ON 05/08/17.

A 12 INCH DRESSER COUPLING FAILED BY SEPARATION ALLOWING TWO 12 INCH 99 PSIG PIPE SEGMENTS TO BE PULLED APART.    ROOT CAUSE:  THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT SUPPORT OF A LIVE GAS MAIN DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE EARTH WAS REMOVED DURING CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY ALLOWING VIBRATION AND PRESSURE TO PULL THE SEGMENTS OUT FROM THE COUPLING.     CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:  MARCH, 2017 - ENBRIDGE EXCAVATED AROUND A PRESSURIZED 99 PSIG OUTLET MAIN IN PREPARATION OF TIE-IN FOR OUTLET PIPING FOR THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED CRARY ST GATE STATION. THE  PIPING WAS LEFT INSUFFICIENTLY SUPPORTED IN EXCAVATION. REMOVAL OF TWO 750 TO 99 PSIG REGULATOR RUNS ALLOWED A PIPING HEADER TO SHIFT AND ALLOW PIPING TO MOVE OUT OF ALIGNMENT, FURTHER ADDING TO THE FORCES ACTING TO PULL THE SEGMENTS FROM THE COUPLING PIPING CHANGE IN 2005 UTILIZED UNRESTRAINED, SHORT-BARREL, INSULATING DRESSER COUPLINGS    USE OF MECHANICAL COUPLING; DESIGN & MATERIAL CHOICE  UNRESTRAINED MECHANICAL COUPLING USED AS PERMANENT METHOD OF JOINING TWO PIPE SEGMENTS.

THE GERC DISPATCHED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING SUPERVISION FROM CON EDISON'S GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) DEPARTMENT.  AT 1:16 P.M., AS GDS PERSONNEL WERE ARRIVING AT THE LOCATION, WESTCHESTER COUNTY FIRE CONTROL PROVIDED UPDATED INFORMATION TO THE GERC INDICATING THAT THE FIRE WAS GAS FED, ACCORDING TO THE NEW ROCHELLE FIRE DEPARTMENT (NRFD).  ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL FROM CON EDISON'S GDS AND GAS CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENTS WERE THEN DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION.     THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING INVOLVED WAS SUPPLIED BY A 0.5-INCH HIGH-PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE (HPPE) GAS SERVICE SUPPLIED FROM A 1.25-INCH HPPE GAS MAIN.  THE GERC IDENTIFIED THE LOCATION OF THE CURB AND MAIN VALVES TO ISOLATE THE AREA, IF REQUIRED.  AT 1:25 P.M., GDS REPORTED THAT THE NRFD HAD CLOSED THE SERVICE VALVE IN THE GARAGE, SECURING THE REPORTED GAS FED FIRE.  AT 1:42 P.M., GDS PROVIDED AN UPDATED REPORT TO THE GERC INDICATING THAT THE INCIDENT HAD INVOLVED A SECONDARY NATURAL GAS IGNITION CAUSED BY ANOTHER FIRE THAT HAD RESULTED FROM THE HOMEOWNER ATTEMPTING TO FILL A SNOW BLOWER WITH GASOLINE INSIDE THE GARAGE.  THE GASOLINE-RELATED PRIMARY IGNITION SPREAD TO A VEHICLE, THE GARAGE AND HOUSE.  THE CURB VALVE, WHICH COULD NOT INITIALLY BE LOCATED BECAUSE IT WAS COVERED WITH ICE AND SNOW, WAS LOCATED WITH ASSISTANCE FROM GDS SUPERVISION AND CLOSED AT 1:50 P.M.  AT 2:05 P.M., GDS SUPERVISION REPORTED TO THE GERC THAT THE GASOLINE-RELATED PRIMARY IGNITION APPEARED TO HAVE MELTED THE GAS SERVICE REGULATOR AND GAS METER, AND DAMAGED THE GAS METER PIPING, HOUSE PIPING, AND EXTENSION SERVICE.      ODORANT READINGS TAKEN AT 149 THORNBURY ROAD WERE WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE (0.25% GAS-IN-AIR).  NO NATURAL GAS READINGS WERE DETECTED IN TEST POINTS CHECKED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.  THE CURB VALVE AND SERVICE VALVE WERE LEFT OFF AND LOCKED, AND WERE VERIFIED TO BE HOLDING.  GAS CONSTRUCTION RESPONDED TO CUT AND CAP THE GAS SERVICE AT THE MAIN.  DAMAGE WAS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $50,000.  NO INJURIES OR ILLNESSES WERE REPORTED.  CHANNEL 12 NEWS WAS ON LOCATION.  NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (NYSPSC) AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (VIA THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER).

ATMOS ENERGY PERSONNEL  ELIMINATED GAS FLOW TO THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPE - ISOLATION POINTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND LOCATED, AND THE VALVES WERE CLOSED AT 4:09 PM.  ALL OF THE ROADS EXCEPT THE 2100 BLOCK OF MAIN STREET WERE REOPENED.  AS A RESULT OF THE MAIN ISOLATION, TWO COMMERCIAL SERVICES WERE TEMPORARILY INTERRUPTED.  GAS FLOW WAS REINSTATED AT 12:20 AM (MARCH11TH) ALLOWING THE INTERRUPTED SERVICES TO BE RESTORED.  APPROXIMATELY 29 YARDS OF MAIN WAS DEACTIVATED AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.  THE 2100 BLOCK OF MAIN STREET WAS REOPENED UPON COMPLETION OF THE DEACTIVATION.

ATMOS ENERGY FOLLOWED IT APPROVED PROCEDURES, IN COMPLIANCE WITH PART 192.603(B), TO RECORD THIS NEW ASSET IN THE GIS ELECTRONIC MAPPING SYSTEM USED BY ITS LOCATORS.  DUE TO THE TIME IT TAKES TO COMPLETE THIS PROCESS, THIS ASSET WAS NOT REFLECTED IN THE ELECTRONIC MAPPING AT THE TIME THE LOCATE TICKET WAS COMPLETED IN THIS AREA ON MARCH 3, 2017.  AS A RESULT, THE NEW ASSET WAS NOT MARKED WITH THE LOCATE TICKET.  HOWEVER, THERE WERE EXISTING VISUAL INDICATORS IN PLACE, INCLUDING A FRESH DITCH LINE COVERED WITH NEW ASPHALT IN-LINE WITH THE POINT OF DAMAGE; VISIBLE AND YELLOW PAINTED GAS VALVE BOXES ON MAIN STREET 15 YARDS FROM THE POINT OF DAMAGE; AND A LARGE CAPACITY METER IN THE ALLEY FOR 2121 MAIN STREET.  BECAUSE THE THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTOR HAD AN OBLIGATION PER 18 TAC 18.4 TO MAKE A VISUAL CHECK FOR ANY UNMARKED UNDERGROUND PIPELINES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ABOVE-GROUND PIPELINE VALVES, METER SETS, AND OTHER VISUAL MARKINGS, THE PRIMARY CAUSE THAT LED TO THE INCIDENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE INSUFFICIENT EXCAVATION PRACTICES.

THERE WAS NO EXPLOSION, BUT A SUSTAINED FIRE CAUSED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE RESIDENCE. NO ONE WAS INJURED. BLACK HILLS WAS NOTIFIED AT 4:45_ A.M. AND RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AT 4:55 A.M. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT GAS SERVICE TO THE RESIDENCE WAS OFF. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE HOMEOWNER NEGATIVE NEGLIGENTLY ALLOWED A LARGE ACCUMULATION OF SNOW, UP TO THE EAVE LEVEL, TO DEVELOP OVER THE GAS METER AND PIPING. THE GAS PIPE DEVELOPED A CRACK AS A RESULT OF THE DOWNWARD FORCE OF THE ACCUMULATED SNOW. THERE WERE NO REPAIRS UNDERTAKEN, AS THE HOMEOWNER DECIDED TO TEAR DOWN THE HOUSE AND CONSTRUCT A NEW HOUSE AT THIS LOCATION. BLACK HILLS REESTABLISHED NATURAL GAS SERVICE TO THE NEW HOUSE. THE ORIGINAL SERVICE LINE AND METER WERE NOT USED. A NEW SERVICE LINE AND METER WERE INSTALLED ONCE THE NEW HOUSE WAS CONSTRUCTED. IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE, THE NEW GAS METER WAS LOCATED ON THE GABLE END OF THE HOUSE."

BRADLEY ATKINS (SOUTHEASTERN NATURAL GAS SERVICES OF ROME) WAS IN THE HOLE AND HAD A 2"" STEEL GAS LINE EXPOSED WITH A SHORT SECTION CUT OUT. AT THE TIME I ARRIVED HE STILL HAD GAS BLEEDING FROM THE SOUTH END OF THE LINE WHERE HE WAS WELDING ON SOMETHING AND GAS FROM THE NORTH END OF THE LINE WHICH WAS OPEN AND HAD BEEN SET ON FIRE. I SPOKE WITH BRADLEY AND HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT THERE MUST BE ANOTHER FEED ON THE NORTH END OF THE LINE SO I TOLD HIM I WOULD SEE IF I COULD FIND WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM.   4:35 PM: I ASKED SHANE FERGUSON TO PULL THE BACKHOE TO A VALVE ABOUT 100 FEET NORTH OF THE HOLE WHERE THE LINE WAS EXPOSED. I WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD TRIED TO OPERATE THE VALVE AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS STRIPED. I INSTRUCTED SHANE TO DIG THE VALVE UP. ONCE THE VALVE WAS EXPOSED I PUT A PIPE WRENCH ON THE VALVE TO SEE IF IT WOULD MOVE AND PARTIALLY OPERATED IT.   4:45 PM: I RETURNED TO THE HOLE WHERE THE LINE WAS EXPOSED AND SOMEONE TOLD ME BRADLEY HAD BEEN BURNED.  BRADLEY WAS OVER AT HIS TRUCK SO I WALKED OVER AND ASKED HIM IF HE WAS OK, HE SAID HE WAS FINE BUT I TOLD HIM HE NEEDED TO GET CHECKED OUT. BRADLEY WANTED HIS WIFE TO DRIVE HIM TO THE DOCTOR SO WHILE WE WERE WAITING BRADLEY GAVE ME INSTRUCTIONS TO GIVE TO LONNIE TANNER WHO WAS COMING TO FINISH THE JOB. I WROTE THE INSTRUCTIONS DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER.   5:15 PM:  BRADLEY LEFT FOR THE HOSPITAL WITH HIS WIFE.    5:20 PM:  AT THIS TIME WE PINCHED OFF THE LINE WHICH WAS STILL BURNING ON THE NORTH SECTION OF THE CUT OUT SECTION AND THE GAS HAD BLED OFF OF THE SOUTH END OF THE LINE. I WALKED OVER ACROSS HIGHWAY 140 TO THE REGULATOR STATION FEEDING SHAW TO SEE IF I COULD FIGURE OUT WHERE THE GAS WHICH WAS STILL ON THE NORTH END OF THE LINE WAS COMING FROM. AT THE REGULATOR STATION SOUTHEASTERN NATURAL GAS SERVICES OF ROME HAD TAKEN OUT A 1/4"" PLUG ON THE INLET SIDE OF REGULATOR WHICH WAS STILL BLEEDING GAS OFF THE LINE ON THE NORTH SECTION OF LINE. A 2"" VALVE ON THE OUTLET SIDE TO SHAW HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY TURNED OFF TRAPPING THE LINE PACK BETWEEN THE REGULATOR STATION AND SHAW WHICH IS ABOUT 350 FEET OF 4"" HDPE LINE.   5:35 PM:  I BLED THE GAS OFF ON THE SHAW SIDE OF REGULATOR STATION AND THE GAS ALSO STOPPED ON THE BLEEDING PLUG ON THE INLET SIDE SO THE GAS HAD BEEN BLEEDING BACK THROUGH A VALVE ON THE REGULATOR STATION. ALL THE GAS WAS OFF BOTH ENDS OF THE LINE BY 5:45 PM.  5:45 PM: WE WAITED FOR LONNIE TANNER TO ARRIVE.  6:15 PM:  LONNIE TANNER ARRIVED AND I GAVE HIM THE PAPER WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH BRADLEY HAD LEFT FOR HIM. LONNIE COMPLETED THE JOB PER THE INSTRUCTIONS.   7:30 PM:  AT THIS TIME I KNEW BRADLEY WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL SO I CAME BACK TO THE OFFICE TO MAKE TELEPHONE CALLS.    7:35 PM:  I CALLED JEFF BAGGETT WITH GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AND INFORMED HIM OF THE INCIDENT. 8:02 PM:  I CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER TO INFORM THEM OF THE INCIDENT.

THE INDIVIDUAL WAS TRANSPORTED TO ARROWHEAD REGIONAL TO BE TREATED FOR HIS INJURIES.     SCG FIRST RESPONDERS ARRIVED TO THE SCENE AND REPORTED GAS INDICATIONS AT THE MSA. CONSEQUENTLY, A STEP II LEAK INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED SUCCESSFULLY. PRESSURE AND LOCK-UP WAS WITHIN TOLERANCE AND THE METER WAS HARD CLOSED.  UNDERGROUND SAMPLES WERE TAKEN TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK.  LEAK INDICATIONS WERE FOUND AT THE MAIN TO MAIN TIE-IN, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 15 FT FROM THE GARAGE WHERE THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THE LEAK WAS FOUND ON A CRACKED ALDYL-A TEE FITTING AT THE MAIN TO MAIN TIE-IN. WE FOUND A HAIRLINE CRACK APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2 INCHES LONG ON ONE OF THE ARMS OF THE 'TEE'. THE CRACKED FITTING WAS FOUND UNDERGROUND WITH OTHER SUBSTRUCTURES, YET LOCATED DIRECTLY BELOW A CONCRETE ELECTRICAL BOX OWNER BY GTE. GTE WAS AN OLD TELCO COMPANY NOW OWNED BY FRONTIER. THE EDGE OF THE CONCRETE BOX, LINED UP WITH THE LOCATION OF THE CRACK. THE FITTING AND SEVERAL FEET OF PIPE WERE REPLACED AND SECURED AS EVIDENCE BY THE GAS COMPANY.

AT 23:10, GDS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS AN ACTIVE FIRE IN THE BASEMENT OF A NEW YORK CITY (NYC) TRANSIT SUBSTATION AS PER NYC EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (NYC EM).  THE GERC THEN NOTIFIED CON EDISON'S ELECTRIC OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT, WHICH DISPATCHED A CREW TO THE LOCATION TO ASSIST.  ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL FROM CON EDISON'S GAS CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT WERE ALSO DISPATCHED BY THE GERC.  GDS INVESTIGATED OUTSIDE AND, AT 23:29, REPORTED DETECTING 50% GAS-IN-AIR INSIDE ELECTRIC MANHOLE M10262.  ACCORDING TO THE FDNY, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AN ELECTRICAL OR GAS EXPLOSION IN MANHOLE M10262 PRIOR TO GDS' ARRIVAL.  GDS THEN OPENED AND VENTED MANHOLE M10262.  AT 00:05, CON EDISON GDS SUPERVISION REPORTED A BLOWING GAS CONDITION INSIDE THE BASEMENT OF THE SUBSTATION AT AN ELECTRICAL CONDUIT, WHERE A FLAME WAS VISIBLE.  A MULTIPLE RESOURCE RESPONSE EVENT (CODE MURRE) WAS THEN INITIATED BY THE GERC.  ON DECEMBER 26, 2016, AT 00:42, CON EDISON GDS SUPERVISION REPORTED DETECTING 40% GAS-IN-AIR INSIDE A SECOND ELECTRIC MANHOLE (M10278), WHICH WAS THEN OPENED AND VENTED.  AT 01:48, CON EDISON GDS SUPERVISION REPORTED THAT THE FDNY WAS STANDING BY THE SMALL FLAME THAT WAS VISIBLE AT THE ELECTRICAL CONDUIT IN THE SUBSTATION BASEMENT.  CON EDISON GAS CONSTRUCTION CREWS DETECTED GAS READINGS RANGING FROM 80% TO 100% OVER AN 8-INCH LOW PRESSURE STEEL GAS MAIN (INSTALLED IN 1930) LOCATED ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF WEST 53RD STREET.  NYC EM REPORTED MULTIPLE SUBWAY INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE SUBSTATION FIRE.  AT 02:20, CON EDISON GDS SUPERVISION REPORTED THAT A SMALL FLAME AT THE OPEN-END OF A 4-INCH ELECTRICAL CONDUIT INSIDE THE SUBSTATION EXTINGUISHED WHILE CON EDISON GAS CONSTRUCTION PERSONNEL WORKED TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  PRESSURE AND ODORANT READINGS WERE TAKEN AT A STOVE INSIDE THE SHERATON HOTEL, LOCATED AT 811 SEVENTH AVE., AND WERE FOUND TO BE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE RANGES.  EMERGENCY MAIN STOP-OFF EXCAVATIONS AND LEAK LOCATION OPERATIONS REMAINED ONGOING AND, AT 09:06, A REPAIR CLAMP WAS INSTALLED ON THE LEAK, WHICH WAS FOUND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE 8-INCH STEEL GAS MAIN.  THE 4-INCH STEEL ELECTRICAL CONDUIT GOING INTO THE SUBSTATION WAS DIRECTLY UNDER THE GAS MAIN IN THE AREA WHERE THE LEAK WAS FOUND.  FOLLOWING INSTALLATION OF THE REPAIR CLAMP, ALL GAS READINGS VENTED TO 0%.  A SEGMENT OF NYC TRANSIT'S SUBWAY SYSTEM WAS AFFECTED, RESULTING IN APPROXIMATELY 1,200 EVACUATIONS FROM STRANDED SUBWAY TRAINS.  FDNY FIRE MARSHALS AND NEWS MEDIA FROM CHANNELS 2, 4, 7, 11, AND 12 WERE ON LOCATION.  THE FDNY FIRE MARSHAL INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT ELECTRICAL WIRING WAS THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. NO INJURIES, ILLNESSES, OR BUILDING EVACUATIONS WERE REPORTED.  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE NYC DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WERE NOTIFIED."

ON DECEMBER 16, 2016, ON THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION OF WEST KELLI AVE. AND HWY 62 (MAIN ST.) IN FARMINGTON, ARKANSAS, A VEHICLE TRAVELLING WEST ON HWY 62 LEFT THE ROADWAY AND STRUCK A BLACK HILLS ENERGY ARKANSAS, INC. (""BHEA"" OR THE ""COMPANY"") 2-INCH POST REGULATOR SETTING THAT WAS CONNECTED TO A 4-INCH TRANSMISSION PIPELINE.  THE REGULATOR SETTING WAS LOCATED 28.5 FEET FROM THE CURB OF HWY 62.  THE IMPACT OF THE CAR STRIKING THE SETTING BROKE TWO 2"" X 1"" SWAGES ON THE HIGH PRESSURE SIDE OF THE REGULATOR AND TWO 2"" STEEL PIPES ON THE INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE SIDE OF THE REGULATOR.  THE GAS ESCAPING FROM THE BROKEN PORTIONS OF THE REGULATOR SETTING IGNITED IMMEDIATELY, RESULTING IN A LARGE FIRE.  THE FIRST BHEA EMPLOYEES ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 4:00 P.M. AND 4:10 P.M., AND STARTED THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING THE EFFECTED SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY'S SYSTEM WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FARMINGTON AND FAYETTEVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENTS.  THE EMERGENCY SHUT OFF VALVE FOR THE SETTING, WHICH WAS LOCATED 21 FEET FROM THE SETTING, WAS INACCESSIBLE DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE FIRE.   RATHER THAN STOP THE FIRE BY COMPLETELY SHUTTING OFF THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE PORTION OF BHEA'S SYSTEM IN THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN LOSS OF SERVICE TO HUNDREDS OF CUSTOMERS, BHEA DECIDED, BASED ON ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, TO TAKE MEASURES TO REDUCE OR STOP THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE ISOLATED PORTION OF ITS SYSTEM FEEDING INTO THE REGULATOR SETTING IN ORDER TO STOP THE FIRE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME AVOIDING LOSS OF SERVICE TO ITS CUSTOMERS.  THIS DECISION WAS MADE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN BHEA AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS THAT RESPONDED TO THE SCENE, DURING WHICH ALL PARTIES AGREED THAT THERE WERE NO IMPENDING RISKS TO HUMAN LIFE OR PROPERTY, SINCE THE PERSON THAT WAS APPARENTLY IN THE CAR THAT STRUCK THE REGULATOR SETTING WAS EITHER DECEASED PRIOR TO THE CAR HITTING THE SETTING OR DIED WHEN THE FIRE ERUPTED*, THE OCCUPANTS OF A NEARBY DUPLEX THAT HAD CAUGHT FIRE HAD BEEN SAFELY EVACUATED, AND NO OTHER LIVES WERE IN DANGER.  REGARDING PROPERTY, AS MENTIONED, A DUPLEX NEXT TO THE REGULATOR SETTING HAD CAUGHT FIRE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CAR HIT THE SETTING AND THE FIRE BEGAN, AND IT WAS QUICKLY APPARENT THAT IT COULD NOT BE SAVED FROM TOTAL LOSS.  THERE WAS NO OTHER IMMINENT RISK TO PROPERTY, GIVEN THE FIRE WAS UNDER CONTROL AND WAS NOT SPREADING.  IN ADDITION, BHEA WAS AWARE THAT THE WEATHER WAS FORECASTED TO TURN VERY COLD THE FOLLOWING DAY, WITH TEMPERATURES FORECASTED TO FALL INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS BY THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, MAKING ANY LOSS OF GAS SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS ALL THE MORE CONSEQUENTIAL.    BECAUSE GAS WAS FEEDING INTO THE SETTING FROM FOUR DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE SETTING TOOK SEVERAL HOURS, AND WAS COMPLETED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:40 A.M. ON THE MORNING OF SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17.  AFTER THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS COMPLETED THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THE DAMAGED FACILITIES, BHEA BEGAN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING THE SETTING IN ORDER TO BRING THE SEGMENT OF THE SYSTEM BACK INTO SERVICE, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT 1:15 P.M. ON SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17.  *THERE WAS APPARENTLY ONE PERSON IN THE CAR AT THE TIME IT HIT THE REGULATOR SETTING.  FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, BONE FRAGMENTS FROM THAT PERSON WERE FOUND IN THE CAR.  THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, AND AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, NEITHER THE CAUSE OF DEATH, NOR THE TIME OF DEATH (EITHER BEFORE THE INCIDENT OR AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT) HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.

PGW RESPONDED WITH PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE THE AREA. UPON ARRIVAL AND INVESTIGATION ON THE SCENE PGW FOUND HIGH CARBON MONOXIDE READINGS IN VARIOUS STRUCTURES AND HEAVY SMOKE COMING FROM TWO SEPTA MANHOLES. THE CAUSE OF THE SMOKE AND ODORS WERE DETERMINED TO BE CAUSED BY AN UNDERGROUND SHORT IN SEPTA ELECTRICAL LINES CAUSING A BURN OUT.     BETWEEN 11:30 AND 12:00 HUNDRED HOURS TWO SEPTA EMPLOYEES ATTEMPTED TO VENTILATE A SEPTA MANHOLE IN FRONT OF 915 S. 49TH STREET AND THE MANHOLE IGNITED. THE TWO SEPTA EMPLOYEES WERE BURNED AND TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BY THE PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT. AN ELECTRIC VENTILATOR USED BY THE SEPTA EMPLOYEES MAY HAVE BEEN THE IGNITION SOURCE.     THROUGH INVESTIGATION PGW IDENTIFIED A LOCATION WITH HIGH NATURAL GAS READINGS NEAR THE SOUTH EAST CORNER OF 49TH STREET AND WARRINGTON STREET. PGW EXCAVATED AND FOUND A LEAKING 4 INCH CAST IRON MAIN THAT CROSSED OVER TOP OF THE SEPTA DUCT. ELECTRICAL ARCING FROM THE SEPTA WIRES CREATED A LARGE BURN HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE 4 INCH CAST IRON GAS MAIN. A TEMPORARY REPAIR WAS MADE ON THE 4 INCH MAIN AS OF 16:20 HOURS ON 12/14/2016.

UPON INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A 4-INCH PE PLASTIC MAIN ONE-WAY FEED INSERTED INTO A 16-INCH STEEL CASING FAILED DUE TO EXTERNALLY APPLIED HEAT FROM THE UNCONTROLLED FIRE. THE FIRE CONSISTED OF BURNING MATTRESSES AND OTHER TYPES OF FURNITURE ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING UNDERNEATH THE BRIDGE.    IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 HOURS AFTER GAS HAD BEEN SHUT OFF WHICH WAS AFTER THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S EMERGENCY RESPONDERS HAD DETERMINED THAT THE INCIDENT WAS SAFE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO LEAVE, ONE PERSON WHO PREVIOUSLY WAS TOLD BY COMPANY CREWS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE INCIDENT SCENE, ENTERED UNDERNEATH THE BRIDGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CREEK AND INITIATED A FLASH FIRE FROM AN UNKNOWN HEAT SOURCE WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL SUFFERED BURNS TO THE SKIN AND WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL AND ADMITTED. AN INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE FUEL SOURCE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN NATURAL GAS BASED ON THE LOCATION WHERE THE NATURAL GAS WAS BEING EMITTED OUTSIDE THE BRIDGE ABUTMENT THROUGH THE CASING. EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE NO REMAINING GASES TO DETERMINE THE EXACT SOURCE, IT WAS ORIGINALLY SUSPECTED AND REPORTED THAT THE GASES THAT IGNITED WERE DUE TO INCOMPLETELY COMBUSTIBLE GAS COMPOSITIONS, SUCH AS CARBON MONOXIDE OR OTHER TYPE OF GASEOUS COMPOUNDS TYPICAL OF THE TYPES OF MATERIALS BEING BURNED, GENERALLY FOUND IN SMOKE OR ""SMOKE GAS"". HOWEVER, THROUGH AN INVESTIGATION BY AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE FLASH FIRE WAS MORE LIKELY CAUSED BY THE INJURED PARTY'S IGNITION OF A FLAMMABLE SOURCE SUCH AS A BUG BOMB (MULTIPLE CANISTERS FOUND IN THE AREA) OR OTHER FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE."

NARRATIVE FOR PART H: IN THE PROCESS OF STOPPING OFF A DEAD END SECTION OF 8-INCH COATED STEEL HIGH PRESSURE PIPE AN UNEXCAVATED MECHANICAL COUPLING UPSTREAM OF THE WORK LOCATION PULLED APART.  AS A RESULT OF THIS SEPARATION, TWO MEMBERS OF A CONTRACTOR CREW SUSTAINED INJURIES.  THE MECHANICAL COUPLING WAS A SEAL ONLY DESIGN BUT HAD BEEN SECURED WITH STRAPS WELDED ACROSS THE JOINT THAT FAILED TO RESTRAIN THE PIPE.  THE COMPONENTS IN QUESTION WERE SENT TO LABORATORY FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.  THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE STRAPS FAILED DUE TO AN OVER LOAD CONDITION   AS A RESULT COLUMBIA HAS IMPLEMENTED PROTOCOLS TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE THAT INCLUDE AND ARE NOT LIMITED TO AN INVESTIGATION WHEN EXCAVATING AND WORKING ON METALLIC PIPE THAT MIGHT INCLUDE UNRESTRAINED FITTINGS.  PLEASE CONSIDER THIS INCIDENT REPORT FINAL."

AT 06:37, A DISPATCHER WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK (FDNY) CALLED CON EDISON'S GERC AND REPORTED THAT THE FDNY WAS ON LOCATION FOR AN OUTSIDE GAS ODOR IN THE AREA OF A PRIVATE HOUSE LOCATED AT 300 WEST 234TH STREET.  CON EDISON'S GERC DISPATCHED A LEAK SURVEY MECHANIC TO THE LOCATION AT 06:39.     AT 06:45, THE FDNY REPORTED EVACUATING THE PRIVATE HOUSE AT 300 WEST 234TH STREET BECAUSE OF THE GAS ODOR.  A MULTIPLE RESOURCE RESPONSE EVENT (CODE MURRE) WAS THEN INITIATED BY CON EDISON AND ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL - A SUPERVISOR AND MECHANIC FROM CON EDISON'S GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) DEPARTMENT - WERE DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION BY THE GERC.  THE GERC THEN CALLED THE FDNY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE LOCATION OF THE CURB VALVE, AT WHICH TIME THE FDNY REPORTED THAT IT HAD ALREADY CLOSED THE CURB VALVE ON THE GAS SERVICE LINE SUPPLYING 300 WEST 234TH STREET.  A FIELD OPERATIONS PLANNER WITH CON EDISON'S GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE GROUP (ERG) WAS DISPATCHED AT 07:05.  AT 07:08, THE FDNY REPORTED THAT IT HAD REQUESTED ASSISTANCE FROM THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT (NYPD) BECAUSE OF A POSSIBLE DRUG LAB AT THE LOCATION.     CON EDISON'S LEAK SURVEY MECHANIC ARRIVED AT 07:14.  HE ENTERED THE BASEMENT OF 304 WEST 234TH STREET AND, USING A GAS MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT, DETECTED NO GAS-IN-AIR IN THE AREA OF THE GAS SERVICE POINT OF ENTRY.  THE LEAK SURVEY MECHANIC THEN ENTERED THE BASEMENT OF 300 WEST 234TH STREET AND, USING A GAS MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT, DETECTED NO GAS-IN-AIR IN THE AREA OF THE GAS SERVICE POINT OF ENTRY.  THE GDS MECHANIC AND GDS SUPERVISOR ARRIVED AT 07:26 AND 07:28, RESPECTIVELY.  TOGETHER WITH THE LEAK SURVEY MECHANIC, THEY ENTERED THE BASEMENT OF 300 WEST 234TH STREET TO INVESTIGATE AND VERIFY SHUTDOWN OF THE GAS SERVICE.  WHEN THE CON EDISON ERG FIELD OPERATIONS PLANNER ARRIVED AT 07:31, HE JOINED THE OTHER CON EDISON RESPONDERS IN THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING.  MOMENTS LATER, AT 07:32, THE GDS SUPERVISOR AND ERG FIELD OPERATIONS PLANNER REPORTED THAT AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE BUILDING AND THAT ALL CON EDISON EMPLOYEES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR.     TWO OF THE FOUR CON EDISON EMPLOYEES IN THE BASEMENT AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES.  AT THE SUGGESTION OF EMS, ALL FOUR CON EDISON EMPLOYEES WERE TRANSPORTED TO MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER FOR EVALUATION.  THE AREA IS SUPPLIED BY A 4-INCH HIGH-PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE (HPPE) GAS MAIN, WITH A 1-INCH HPPE BRANCH SERVICE SUPPLYING 300 AND 304 WEST 234TH STREET.  FOUR MAIN VALVES WERE CLOSED TO ISOLATE GAS SUPPLY TO THE AREA, WHICH INTERRUPTED GAS SERVICE TO NINE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS.  A RECENT LEAK SURVEY OF THE AREA, CONDUCTED A WEEK PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2016, FOUND NO LEAKS.  ODORANT LEVELS AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PRESSURE SUPPLYING THE AREA WERE CHECKED AFTER THE INCIDENT AND FOUND TO BE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE RANGES.    MULTIPLE MEDIA OUTLETS WERE ON LOCATION. A FDNY BATTALION CHIEF WAS STRUCK AND KILLED BY DEBRIS PROPELLED BY THE EXPLOSION.  INJURIES TO THE PUBLIC, THE NYPD, AND OTHER FDNY PERSONNEL WERE REPORTED.  THE NYPD ISOLATED THE AREA AS A CRIME SCENE.  MULTIPLE MUNICIPAL AGENCIES WERE ON LOCATION, INCLUDING FDNY, NYPD, NYSDPS, NYCOEM, NYCDOB, NYCDEP, ATF, DEA, AND DHS.  NYSPSC, NYCDEP, AND USDOT WERE NOTIFIED.  NYSPSC SURESH THOMAS WAS NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED TO LOCATION.    AS OF JULY 25,2017, LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INVESTIGATION REMAINS ONGOING AND NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BECOME AVAILABLE SINCE THE INITIAL INCIDENT REPORT SUBMITTED TO PHMSA ."

PGS CONTACTED THE THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTOR WORKING IN THE AREA - PIKE ELECTRIC - AND CONFIRMED BOTH THAT PIKE ELECTRIC EXCAVATED INTO THE PIPELINE, AND THAT THE PIPELINE WAS LEAKING.  A PGS TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND WHILE IN ROUTE, HE RECEIVED A FOLLOW-UP TELEPHONE CALL FROM PIKE ELECTRIC, WHICH INFORMED HIM THAT ESCAPING NATURAL GAS FROM THE PIPELINE HAD IGNITED. PGS DISPATCHED THE REPAIR CONTRACTOR.     THE DAMAGED LINE WAS A 6-INCH NATURAL GAS PLASTIC MAIN THAT PROVIDED SERVICE TO APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOMES.  THE GAS PIPELINE WAS VERIFIED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT PRESSURE TO PREVENT AN INTERRUPTION TO THE DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS DURING THE LEAK.   THE BONITA SPRINGS FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ABLE TO CONTAIN THE FIRE FROM SPREADING, AND PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE.  THE ASSISTANT FIRE CHIEF CONFIRMED THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT COULD CONTROL THE FIRE WHILE PGS WORKED TO INSTALL A BYPASS LINE (A BYPASS LINE WAS INSTALLED TO PREVENT AN INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE TO THE DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS WHEN THE GAS MAIN WAS SQUEEZED OFF).  THE BYPASS LINE WAS PLACED IN SERVICE AT APPROXIMATELY 03:00 ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2016.  AFTER THIS INSTALLATION, GAS SERVICE TO THE DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS WAS THEN BEING SUPPLIED VIA A COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS TRAILER.  THE DAMAGED GAS MAIN WAS SQUEEZED OFF, THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED, AND THE SITE WAS ""MADE SAFE"" AT APPROXIMATELY 03:30 ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2016.      PIKE ELECTRIC WAS CONTRACTED BY FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY TO EXCAVATE HOLES USING AN AUGER, IN ORDER TO INSTALL NEW POWER POLES.  PIKE ELECTRIC NOTIFIED SUNSHINE 811 OF THE PLANNED EXCAVATIONS.  PGS RECEIVED THE SUNSHINE 811 NOTIFICATIONS, AND MARKED THE PIPELINE VIA A SPRAY PAINT OFFSET INDICATION AND YELLOW FLAGS, AS REQUIRED.  THE PIPELINE WAS UNDETECTABLE USING THE TRACER WIRE, SO PGS USED MAPS TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF THE PIPELINE.  THE PIPELINE MARKINGS WERE VERIFIED AS ACCURATE.

PRIOR TO THE SEPARATION, THE MAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE POSI-HOLD COMPRESSION COUPLING EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN PRESSURE APPROXIMATELY 10 PSIG ABOVE 110% OF MAOP. THE OVER-PRESSURE ABOVE THE ALLOWED 10% BUILD-UP WAS THE RESULT OF UNDERSIZED PIPING BETWEEN THE REGULATOR AND RELIEF VALVE WHICH LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF FLOW THE RELIEF VALVE COULD PASS TO STAY WITHIN THE NECESSARY TOLERANCE FOR BUILD-UP.

IN EARLY 2016, ENTERGY FOSSIL GROUP REQUESTED ENOI GAS OPERATIONS TO PHYSICALLY SEPARATE THE TWO GAS SERVICES THAT DELIVERED GAS FROM THE ENOI DISTRIBUTION MAIN ON PARIS RD TO THE GENERATING UNITS FROM THE POWER PLANT.  ALL GAS WORK WAS PERFORMED BY ENOI GAS OPERATION PERSONNEL.  THE SCOPE OF WORK WAS TO CLOSE THE SERVICE VALVES SERVING THE PLANT, PURGE THE SERVICE LINES, CUT AND WELD A STEEL CAP ON BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM ENDS TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL SEPARATION. INITIAL WORK WAS ON THE 20 INCH LINE FEEDING MICHOUD UNITS 1 AND 2.  PRIMARY WORK ONSITE WAS:  1. EXCAVATING THE SERVICE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE LINE.  EXCAVATION DIMENSIONS WERE APPROXIMATELY 8 FEET WIDE BY 15 FEET LONG BY 8 FEET DEEP TO ALLOW FOR COMPLETE 360 ACCESS TO SERVICE.  2. PURGING THE SERVICE LINE WITH INERT GAS, AND THEN GAPPING THE SERVICE TO ISOLATE THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT INTO THE PLANT.  3. WELDING STEEL CAPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE NEW GAP.  4. OPENING THE SERVICE VALVE TO RE-PRESSURIZE THE SERVICE LINE UPSTREAM OF THE GAP.  WITHIN 3 MINUTES OF HAVING THE UPSTREAM VALVE FULLY OPEN, THE PRESSURE RELEASE OCCURRED (13:10 CST).  APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET UPSTREAM OF THE EXCAVATION, THE GAPPED SERVICE SEGMENT WAS BLOWN OUT OF A STRAPPED STYLE 40 DRESSER COUPLING.  THE SERVICE VALVE WAS CLOSED WITHIN 7 MINUTES.  THE RESULT OF THE BLOWOUT BUCKLED AND CRACKED CONCRETE ROADWAY, BLEW ALL THE DIRT UNDERNEATH ROADWAY AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE COUPLING INTO AND OUT OF THE EXCAVATION. SEVEN EMPLOYEES RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES AND WERE TREATED AND RELEASED.  TWO EMPLOYEES RECEIVED INJURIES SEVERE ENOUGH TO REQUIRE HOSPITALIZATION FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD.    PHMSA STATE PARTNER, LA DNR, OFFICE OF CONSERVATION, PIPELINE DIVISION WAS NOTIFIED AT 14:05 CST THAT THE INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED, WHICH WAS WITHIN ONE HOUR OF FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAS RELEASE.  ENTERGY NOTIFIED PHMSA VIA THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 18:26 CST WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT THE EVENT MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF AN 'INCIDENT'.  ENTERGY SUBMITTED THE REQUIRED INCIDENT REPORT AND ORIGINALLY CLASSIFIED THE EVENT AS 'OTHER' BUT UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND GATHERING MORE FACTS, RE-CLASSIFIED THE CAUSE AS PIPE, WELD, OR JOINT FAILURE (MECHANICAL FITTING FAILURE)."

WE LOCATED OUR FACILITIES FOR THE CONTRACTOR ON AUGUST 3, 2016.    WE WERE NOTIFIED BY THE CONTRACTOR ON AUGUST 4, 2016 AT 1342 THAT THEY HAD HIT ONE OF OUR GAS LINES AT THIS LOCATION AND IT WAS ON FIRE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 1347.  WE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 1351 TO FIND A GAS SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN HIT AND WAS ON FIRE ALONG WITH THE CONTRACTOR'S MINI EXCAVATOR.     THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PROTECTED EXPOSURES IN THE AREA OF THE FIRE WHILE WE BEGAN TO SHUT DOWN THE SERVICE LINE. WE PINCHED THE SERVICE LINE OFF APPROXIMATELY 56 FEET FROM THE DAMAGED AREA TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE AT 1417.  WE NOTIFIED THIS INCIDENT TO THE ALABAMA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AT 1423 AND TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 1446 ON AUGUST 4, 2016.    WE TALKED WITH THE CONTRACTOR'S OPERATOR WHO WAS EXCAVATING THE HOLE AND HE REPORTED THAT THE GAS IGNITED AS SOON AS THE LINE WAS HIT. HE STATED THAT IT SINGED HIS ARM HAIR, BUT HE WAS NOT INJURED. WITH THE CONTRACTOR'S ASSISTANCE, WE REMOVED THE MINI EXCAVATOR'S BUCKET THAT WAS STILL IN THE APPROXIMATELY 6 1/2 FOOT LONG BY 3 FOOT WIDE EXCAVATION TO SEE THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE. WE OBSERVED THAT THE BUCKET HAD COMPLETELY SEVERED THE 3/4 INCH PE GAS SERVICE LINE AND THE 3/4 INCH CONDUIT CONTAINING ELECTRICAL WIRES TO THE PARKING LOT LIGHTS. ALSO LOCATED IN THE HOLE WERE TWO 3/4 INCH PVC SPRINKLER LINE WITH CONTROL WIRES, A 3/4 INCH CONDUIT CONTAINING ELECTRICAL WIRES, AND A 2 INCH CONDUIT CONTAINING TELECOMMUNICATION WIRES WHICH WERE NOT DAMAGED.     WE MEASURED THE DISTANCE OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE FROM LOCATE MARKS IN TWO LOCATIONS TO DETERMINE IF THE LINE WAS LOCATED WITHIN THE TOLERANCE ZONE OF THE LOCATE MARKS. THE METHOD WE USED TO DETERMINE THIS WAS WE PULLED A TAPE MEASURE FROM THE LOCATE MARK ON THE PARKING LOT CURB NEXT TO THE EXCAVATION AND LOCATE MARK BETWEEN THE EXCAVATION AND THE ROAD. WE PULLED ANOTHER TAPE 90 OFF THAT TAPE AND MEASURED TO THE CENTER LINE OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE IN TWO LOCATIONS. THE SERVICE LINE DISTANCE AT THE FIRST LOCATION, CLOSEST TO THE PARKING LOT CURB, WAS 23 3/8 INCHES AND THE DISTANCE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE DITCH WAS 21 INCHES FROM THE LOCATE MARK. FROM THESE MEASUREMENTS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SERVICE LINE LOCATION WAS NOT IN THE TOLERANCE ZONE OF THE LOCATE MARKS. THE SERVICE LINE WAS BURIED 15 1/2 INCHES FROM THE TOP OF GROUND TO THE TOP OF THE SERVICE LINE.     AFTER FINAL INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL FURTHER STEPS IN LOCATING AND EXCAVATION COULD HAVE BEEN PERFORMED TO HELP MITIGATE THE RISK OF DAMAGE TO THE GAS SERVICE LINE:    1.  DURING THE LOCATING PROCESS INSTEAD OF INDUCING A SIGNAL TO LOCATE THE SERVICE, A DIRECT CONNECTION COULD HAVE BEEN PERFORMED         TO INDUCE A LOWER FREQUENCY, POSSIBLY REDUCING THE CHANCES OF INTERFERENCE BY THE OTHER UTILITIES IN THE AREA.    2.  THE SIGNAL COULD HAVE BEEN "" BALANCED"" TO VERIFY THERE WAS A SYMMETRICAL MAGNETIC FIELD FOR THE SERVICE LINE.    3.  THE CONTRACTOR COULD HAVE UTILIZED A NON-INVASIVE EXCAVATION METHOD TO DETERMINE THE PRECISE LOCATION OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE          BECAUSE MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT WAS BEING UTILIZED WITHIN THE TOLERANCE ZONE OF THE LOCATE MARKS."

BURNS	REGIONAL OPERATIONS DIRECTOR	318-429-4495	bobby.r.burns@centerpointenergy.com 	"THE INITIAL POST-INCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED EROSION OF SOIL AND CAVE IN OF SURFACE PAVEMENT AROUND A SEWER MANHOLE DISCOVERED ON MAY 6, 2016, WHICH CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE CONNECTION OF A SERVICE LINE PROVIDING SERVICE TO 2437 FAIRFIELD AVE. THIS SERVICE LINE CONNECTION WAS REPAIRED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW SERVICE LINE AND TAP ON MAY 6, 2016. THIS NEW SERVICE LINE AND CONNECTION DID NOT LEAK AFTER MAY 6. THERE WAS NO CRACK IN THE CAST IRON MAIN AT THE TIME THAT THE MAY 6 SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT WAS COMPLETED; THE INSPECTION AT THAT TIME DID NOT REVEAL A LOSS OF SUPPORT UNDER THE CAST IRON MAIN. SERVICE TO 2437 FAIRFIELD WAS LEFT OFF AT THE TIME OF THIS REPAIR DUE TO CUSTOMER NOT BEING HOME. ON MAY 23, 2016 A CENTERPOINT ENERGY EMPLOYEE RETURNED TO RESTORE SERVICE TO THIS RESIDENCE AT THE CUSTOMER'S REQUEST. DURING THIS RESTORATION A BAR HOLE INSPECTION WAS MADE IN WHICH THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A LEAK. ON MAY 26, 2016 A CENTERPOINT ENERGY CONTRACT SERVICES INSPECTOR WENT BACK TO SITE OF THE SERVICE LINE REPAIR AND PERFORMED A VISUAL INSPECTION, AND AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A LEAK. ON JULY 31, 2016 AT APP. 16:18, CENTERPOINT ENERGY WAS NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED TO TWO EMERGENCY CALLS REPORTED AT 2437 FAIRFIELD AVE. AN EMERGENCY LEAK INVESTIGATION ORDER AND AN EMERGENCY FIRE INVESTIGATION ORDER WERE CREATED. TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT APP. 16:53 TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION. DURING THE INVESTIGATION OF JULY 31, GAS WAS DETECTED NEAR THE STRUCTURE, AFTER WHICH TELEPHONIC REPORTS WERE MADE TO NRC AND STATE REGULATORY OFFICIALS. DURING ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT, A FRACTURE WAS FOUND AUGUST 2, 2016, ON THE CAST IRON MAIN AT A LOCATION OF AN ADJACENT STEEL SERVICE LINE TAP, WHICH WAS 2.8' AWAY FROM THE NEWLY INSTALLED POLY SERVICE LINE TAP. METALLURGICAL INSPECTION OF JANUARY 18, 2017, SHOWED THAT THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS/STRENGTH WAS WELL PRESERVED WITHOUT ANY GRAPHITIC CORROSION BEYOND SHALLOW SURFACE CORROSION. THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AND SUBSEQUENT GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE PIPE FRACTURED DUE TO A RECENT OVERLOAD EVENT OCCURRING AFTER A LOSS OF SUPPORT, MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY LOSS OF SOIL BY WATER INFILTRATION AND EROSION THROUGH THE VOIDS, CRACKS AND OPENINGS AROUND THE VARIOUS SEWER LINE CONNECTIONS IN THE SEWER MANHOLE AND ON THE MANHOLE WALL ITSELF. THE FRACTURE OCCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MAY 26, 2016 INSPECTION AND BEFORE THE JULY 31, 2016 INCIDENT. THE GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE CAST-IRON MAIN LINE UNDERWENT DEFLECTIONS DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF THE LOSS OF SOIL SUPPORT FROM THE SOIL CAVING, RESULTING IN AN UNDETECTED INCREASE IN STRESSES IN THE MAIN PIPE AT THE LOCATION OF THE CONNECTION OF THE STEEL SERVICE LINE WHERE THE CRACK OCCURRED. THE ODOR OF NATURAL GAS WAS DETECTED BY PERSONS PRESENT AT THE SUBJECT PROPERTY ON JULY 29, JULY 30 AND THE MORNING OF JULY 31 WITHOUT ANYONE CONTACTING CENTERPOINT BEFORE THE FIRE OCCURRED."

COMPANY PERSONNEL DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY LOCATE AND MARK ALL OF THE GAS FACILITIES WITHIN THE DELINEATED AREA IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS LINE LOCATING PROCEDURES. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTIGATION TO DATE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IF ITS LINE LOCATING PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED A DISCREPANCY IN THE ALIGNMENT OF THE FACILITY WOULD HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN THE MAP, ASBUILT AND THE ACTUAL FIELD FACILITY LOCATION.    PART G3, 14: IN ADDITION TO THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT LOCATING PRACTICES THE COMPANY IDENTIFIED AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTING CAUSE. THE EXCAVATION DAMAGE OCCURRED AT OR NEAR AN UNMAPPED AND NON-LOCATED 4-INCH 45 DEGREE ELBOW THAT DID NOT APPEAR ON AS-BUILT DOCUMENTATION. THE EXCAVATION DAMAGE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE OCCURRED ON A PORTION OF THE PIPE THAT CHANGED DIRECTION BECAUSE THE 4"" PE MAIN AND VALVE WERE EXPOSED AND BEING SPOTTED BY COMPANY EMPLOYEES WHILE THE BACKHOE OPERATOR WAS REMOVING DIRT ADJACENT TO THE PIPELINE FACILITY."

THE AMEREN ILLINOIS FIRST RESPONDER STOPPED THE BLOWING GAS USING AN EXPANDABLE PLUG INTO THE CUT 1/2"" SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 80 MINUTES LATER, AFTER THE CUT GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN PLUGGED AND AN AMEREN ILLINOIS CREW WAS ON SITE TO MAKE REPAIRS, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT THE STRUCTURE LOCATED AT 430 N WEST STREET. THE POST INVESTIGATION OF THE AREA REQUIRED A TEMPORARY OUTAGE TO 33 GAS CUSTOMERS.      REVISION AS OF (12/20/2016):    THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT, GIVEN THE RELATIVELY SHORT TIMEFRAME BETWEEN THE DAMAGED GAS SERVICE AT 419 N WEST ST AND THE INCIDENT OCCURRING AT 430 N WEST ST, IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE THIRD PARTY DAMAGE OF THE GAS SERVICE. THE CONTRACTOR INSTALLING A WATER MAIN IN THE STREET HAD A VALID DIG TICKET, BUT THE SERVICE WAS INACCURATELY MARKED INACCURATELY MARKED IN THE FIELD BY THE LOCATOR.

PART A, LINE 12 - THERE WERE TWO INJURIES REPORTED, HOWEVER AMEREN ILLINOIS COULD ONLY CONFIRM THAT ONE REQUIRED INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION.  PART A, LINE 13 - THE GAS MAIN WAS SHUT DOWN AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. THE AMEREN ILLINOIS FIRST RESPONDER HAD REMOVED THE PLUG STOPPER AFTER THE INCIDENT, AND THEN THE ADJACENT 1-1/4"" PLASTIC GAS MAIN WAS EXCAVATED AND SQUEEZED OFF INTERRUPTING SERVICE TO THE 400 BLOCK OF N WEST ST.

ACCORDING TO INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED BY THE ASHLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYEES AT THE PROPERTY, AS WELL AS PATRONS OF THE STORE PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, A CHEMICAL ODOR, NOT NATURAL GAS, WAS SMELLED ON SITE.    A  COLUMBIA SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS ON SITE TO SET A GAS METER AT THE GAS STATION THE DAY PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, MAY 2, 2016.

THE CURB VALVE'S ""OFF"" POSITION WAS VERIFIED WHEN EXCAVATED FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT.    FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, ON MAY 3, 2016, THE CURB VALVE AND THE CUSTOMER-OWNED SERVICE LINE WERE EXPOSED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE SERVICE LINE DOWNSTREAM OF THE CURB VALVE HAD BEEN SEVERED PRIOR TO THE MAY 2, 2016 SITE VISIT BY COLUMBIA.

ON WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 2016, COLUMBIA, ALONG WITH OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES, TOOK SAMPLES FROM SIX (6) LOCATIONS UNDER THE CONCRETE PAD OF THE STRUCTURE.  THE RESULTS OF THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT VERY LOW LEVELS OF DEGRADED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND VERY LOW LEVELS OF NATURAL GAS WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME THE SAMPLES WERE TAKEN.

TWO LONGITUDINAL CRACKS TOTALING 32 INCHES IN LENGTH WERE FOUND ON THE BOTTOM SECTION OF THE PIPE. INSTALLATION OF A STAINLESS STEEL CLAMP WAS ATTEMPTED TO REPAIR THE LEAK; HOWEVER IT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE INCIDENT WAS DEEMED TO BE REPORTABLE ON FEBRUARY 27, 2016, WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE REPAIR COSTS WOULD PROBABLY EXCEED $50,000. THE COMPANY ORDERED A 44 INCH LONG STEEL, SPLIT SLEEVE ENCAPSULATION FITTING AS AN ALTERNATE REPAIR. THE ENCAPSULATION FITTING REQUIRED ADDITIONAL EXCAVATION OF THE PIPE WHICH UNCOVERED A THIRD CRACK 16 INCHES LONG. THE ENCAPSULATION FITTING WAS SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED AROUND THE ORIGINAL TWO CRACKS. THE THIRD CRACK WAS SOAP TAPED AS A TEMPORARY REPAIR. SERVICE TECHNICIANS REMAINED ONSITE TO MONITOR THE LEAK WHILE THE REPAIRS WERE MADE.  IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE PIPE WAS CONSTRUCTED RESTING ON CONCRETE AND BRICK OR IF SUBSIDENCE OVER THE PAST 113 YEARS MOVED THE PIPE TO ITS CURRENT POSITION. THE COMPANY IS ALSO UNABLE TO DETERMINE IF OUTSIDE FORCES FROM THE TRAFFIC ABOVE THE PIPE WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE. THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ROOT CAUSE OF FAILURE HAS PROMPTED THE COMPANY TO ACCELERATE ITS PLANS FOR FULL REPLACEMENT OF THIS PIPE SEGMENT AND ADJOINING MAIN. THE COMPANY HAS PROPOSED REPLACING OR ABANDONING APPROXIMATELY 2,800 FEET OF THE 24 INCH CAST IRON MAIN INVOLVED AND APPROXIMATELY 900 FEET OF 12 INCH CAST IRON MAIN."

THESE VENT LINES WERE BOTH UNSLEEVED, AND CORRODED OVER TIME.  WATER FROM THE SURROUNDING SOIL INFILTRATED THE VENT LINE AND COLLECTED ON TOP OF THE PRIMARY REGULATOR DIAPHRAGM AND FROZE. IN ADDITION, THE VENT LINE WAS PARTIALLY FROZEN AND BLOCKED. THE SECONDARY REGULATOR SERVED TO VENT EXCESS GAS DUE TO ELEVATED PRESSURE. A SERVICE PERSON RESPONDING TO A CALL AT THIS LOCATION FOUND THE COUPLING ON THE SECONDARY VENT LINE DISCONNECTED, AND OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, ""VALVED OUT"" THE SECONDARY REGULATOR TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOWING GAS.  THIS PREVENTED THE INTERNAL RELIEF OF THE SECONDARY GAS SERVICE REGULATOR TO VENT THE EXCESS PRESSURE FROM THE FAILED REGULATOR; THEREFORE BOTH RELIEF VALVES WERE RENDERED INEFFECTIVE, ALLOWING DOWNSTREAM PRESSURE TO BUILD UP TO LEVELS BEYOND RECOMMENDED LIMITS FOR THE CUSTOMERS' EQUIPMENT AND A FIRE RESULTED IN ONE OF THE APARTMENTS.  COOKING LOADS FOR ALL 152 APARTMENTS REMAIN TURNED OFF UNTIL THE ASSIGNED PLUMBER OBTAINS THE PERMIT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS.    IN PART G ABOVE, THE TASK WHICH LED TO THE INCIDENT WAS NOT A COVERED TASK FOR OUR OQ PROGRAM AT THE TIME OF THE SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION; HOWEVER, IT IS A COVERED TASK AT THIS POINT IN TIME.    LAST SERVICE WAS RESTORED ON 9/1/2016"

IN WOODBRIDGE, VA.  WASHINGTON GAS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 15:31. UPON ARRIVAL, THE WASHINGTON GAS TECHNICIAN HAD EXITED HIS VEHICLE AND WAS APPLYING THE APPROPRIATE PPE WHEN A POSSIBLE LOW ORDER EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT. AN ODORANT SAMPLE WAS TAKEN AND THE LEVEL OF ODORANT WAS DETERMINED TO BE ACCEPTABLE.  RELATIVE TO  PART A #13 OF THIS FORM. SELECTING YES WOULD NOT ALLOW THE DATE & TIME TO BE INPUTTED BEFORE THE CURRENT DATE. WG RESPONSE TO PART A #13 IS YES. #13A. 2/8/2016 2100HRS. #13B. CUSTOMER HAS NOT ELECTED TO HAVE NATURAL GAS RESTORED THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY INACTIVE.  PART C #3C. READING TUBE CORP. & REVERE TUBING WERE BRANDS USED FOR BARE COPPER SERVICE. WG IS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY WHICH WAS USED FOR THIS SPECIFIC SERVICE. PART D #2F. THE LEAK SIZE (SIZE OF OPENING ON PIPE) WAS UNKNOWN. KNOWN FACTS INCLUDED THAT GAS WAS MIGRATING INTO 14100 FRANKLIN ST, AND THERE WAS A SUFFICIENT CONCENTRATION OF GAS TO RESULT IN AN IGNITION.   IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT AN ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF GAS LOST, THE HOME SIZE WAS FIGURED AT 2,100 SQ. FT., WITH AN ESTIMATED CEILING HEIGHT OF 8 FT. THIS RESULTS IN AN ESTIMATED HOME VOLUME OF 2,100 SQ. FT. * 8 FT = 16,800 CU. FT. AN EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE WOULD EXIST WHEN APPROXIMATELY 5 - 15% OF A VOLUME OF SPACE IS OCCUPIED BY GAS. USING A CONSERVATIVE VOLUME OF 16,800 CU. FT., 10% (MID-RANGE BETWEEN THE LEL AND UEL) OF THE HOME VOLUME WOULD EQUAL 1,680 CU. FT. AT A HEATING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,040 BTU/CU. FT., THIS WOULD TRANSLATE TO 1,747,200 BTU. AT $3/MMBTU, THIS AMOUNT OF GAS WOULD COST $5.24.  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE FILLED WITH 10% OF GAS DUE TO THE LOCALIZED NATURE OF THE INCIDENT. HOWEVER, USING THE ENTIRE HOME VOLUME PROVIDES A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SOME CONTINGENCIES SUCH AS GAS THAT MAY HAVE MIGRATED ELSEWHERE (UNDERGROUND, OR ESCAPED THE HOME BEFORE THE IGNITION).

TO THE GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER. A CODE MURRE (MULTIPLE RESOURCE RESPONSE EVENT) WAS INITIATED AND NUMEROUS GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) AND CONSTRUCTION CREWS AND SUPERVISORS WERE DISPATCHED. LEAK SURVEY, BRONX GDS AND QUEENS GDS CREWS WERE MOVED TO MANHATTAN TO ASSIST AT THE SITE AND WITH INCOMING LEAK VOLUME. WORTH STREET, BETWEEN WEST BROADWAY AND CHURCH STREET, IS SUPPLIED BY A RADIAL 6"" LOW PRESSURE STEEL MAIN CONNECTED TO A 12"" LOW PRESSURE (LP) CAST IRON MAIN ON THE EAST SIDE OF WEST BROADWAY. THE 6"" MAIN ON WORTH STREET SUPPLIES FOUR SERVICES ONLY AND ENDS IN FRONT OF 53 WORTH STREET. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS AND STEAM OPERATIONS WERE NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED; GAS DISTRIBUTION ENGINEERING WAS NOTIFIED TO IDENTIFY AN ISOLATION PLAN FOR THE 12"" LP CAST IRON MAIN SUPPLYING THE MAIN ON WORTH STREET AND ASSESS THE OUTAGE IMPACT RELATED TO SAME. AT 08:46, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OF NEW YORK (FDNY) REPORTED AN OUTSIDE GAS ODOR AT 57 WORTH ST. WHICH WAS IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE COLLAPSE. GDS ARRIVED AT 08:50, INVESTIGATED AND REPORTED THAT A LARGE CRANE FELL ON WORTH STREET FROM HUDSON ST. TO CHURCH ST. GDS REPORTED NO  GAS OR CO READINGS OR GAS ODORS WERE DETECTED DURING THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION. THE FDNY REQUESTED THE GAS MAIN ON WORTH STREET BE ISOLATED FROM WEST BROADWAY TO CHURCH STREET. AT 10:23, NYCEM REPORTED THE FDNY HAD EVACUATED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY OCCUPANTS OR MORE FROM THE NY STATE COURT BUILDING AT 71 THOMAS STREET DUE TO AN INSIDE GAS ODOR. GDS INVESTIGATED AND DID NOT DETECT ANY GAS ODORS OR READINGS AND NO CO READINGS WERE DETECTED. AN NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT (NYPD) OFFICER INFORMED GDS THE BUILDING WAS NOT EVACUATED DUE TO A GAS ODOR BUT WAS EVACUATED FOR SAFETY DUE TO THE CRANE COLLAPSE NEARBY. AT 11:12, GDS REPORTED THE FOUR SERVICES ON WORTH STREET AND #171 WEST BROADWAY (USED FOR A FIRE BANK STOPPER LOCATION) WERE VERIFIED OFF AT THE SERVICE HEAD VALVES AND AT 11:48, THE STOPPERS WERE INSTALLED IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH FIRE BANKS ISOLATING THE GAS MAIN ON WORTH STREET. AT 14:40, THE CUT AND CAP OF THE 12"" LP CAST IRON MAIN WAS COMPLETED. FIVE SERVICES WERE ISOLATED INTERRUPTING SERVICE TO EIGHT GAS METER ACCOUNTS (ALL COMMERCIAL). THERE WAS NO NEGATIVE SYSTEM IMPACT AS A RESULT OF THIS MAIN ISOLATION. A TOTAL OF TWENTY-TWO GAS ODOR COMPLAINTS WERE RECEIVED IN THE AREA OF THE CRANE COLLAPSE. ALL READINGS WERE VENTED TO 0% GAS READINGS. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT MEDIA COVERAGE OF THIS EVENT AND REPORTING INCLUDED THE PRESENCE OF GAS ODORS IN THE AREA. CON EDISON'S SENIOR EXECUTIVES WERE ON LOCATION AND NYC ELECTED OFFICIALS RESPONDED TO LOCATION INCLUDING MAYOR DIBLASIO.  ON FEBRUARY 10, 2016 AT 07:11, GAS RESTORATION WAS COMPLETED TO ALL AVAILABLE CUSTOMERS, EXCAVATIONS BACKFILLED AND RESTORATION WORK COMPLETED.

THE EPICENTER WAS IN COOK INLET, 162 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE CITY OF ANCHORAGE.      AT APPROXIMATELY 0225, ENSTAR NATURAL GAS COMPANY RECEIVED A CALL TO ITS CALL CENTER FROM EMERGENCY RESPONDERS NOTIFYING IT OF AN IGNITION AND FIRE AT A RESIDENCE LOCATED AT 1213 LILAC LANE IN KENAI, ALASKA.  ENSTAR'S FIRST RESPONDING EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 0238.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, FIRE CREWS EXTINGUISHED THE INITIAL FIRE.  OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE HOURS, CREWS WORKED WITH EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO EVACUATE THE STREET, SHUT DOWN ELECTRICITY TO STRUCTURES ON THE STREET, AND LOCATE THE GAS LEAK.  CREWS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS AN UNDERGROUND GAS LEAK IN FRONT OF 1213 LILAC LANE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 4 A.M., CREWS BEGAN EXCAVATING AT THE SITE OF THE SUSPECTED GAS LEAK.  THE GROUND WAS FROZEN, WITH FROST EXTENDING 2-4 FEET BELOW THE SURFACE, AND THE MAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 8 FEET DEEP AT THIS LOCATION.  DURING THE EXCAVATION, AT APPROXIMATELY 0554, A SECONDARY IGNITION OCCURRED AT 1215 LILAC LANE.  THE ENSUING FIRE DAMAGED THE HOMES AT 1211, 1213, 1215, AND 1217 LILAC LANE.  CREWS SHUT DOWN THE MAIN ON LILAC LANE BY STOPPING GAS FLOW TO THE THREE TIE-IN POINTS THAT FED THE STREET.  CREWS DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS A 1 1/4 INCH STEEL MAIN THAT HAD SEPARATED AT A WELD JOINT.  CREWS REPAIRED THE BROKEN MAIN AND RESTORED SERVICE TO NON-AFFECTED HOMES AT APPROXIMATELY 1800. THROUGHOUT THE DAY, ADDITIONAL ENSTAR CREWS WERE CALLED IN FROM THE KENAI AND ANCHORAGE AREAS TO SUPPORT THE RESPONSE.    FOR THE FOLLOWING TWO AND A HALF WEEKS, ENSTAR CREWS WORKED TO EXTRACT TRAPPED GAS IN THE GROUND.  NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT; ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS REPORTED."

GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OF NEW YORK (FDNY) WERE DISPATCHED, ARRIVED AT 11:23 AND INVESTIGATED. AT 11:39, GDS DETECTED 3% NATURAL GAS IN A SEWER MANHOLE AND OBSERVED GAS BUBBLING IN RAIN WATER ON THE ROAD SURFACE. SUPERVISION WAS NOTIFIED AND GAS CONSTRUCTION WAS DISPATCHED. THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED AND AT 12:45, SUPERVISION REPORTED DETECTING 62% IN ELECTRIC MANHOLE M26008.  THE COVER WAS PULLED TO VENT THE TYPE 1 READINGS. THE FDNY REMAINED ON LOCATION AND ASSISTED GDS INVESTIGATE BUILDINGS AND SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES IN THE AREA TO ENSURE NO GAS MIGRATED INTO THESE LOCATIONS. AT 13:36, SUPERVISION REPORTED A PROBABLE WATER MAIN BREAK IN THE AREA DUE TO WATER INFILTRATION INTO THE REPAIR EXCAVATION AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF EAST 188 STREET AND PARK AVENUE AND N.Y.C. DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEP) WAS NOTIFIED TO RESPOND.  AT 13:48, GDS REPORTED A GAS FIRE IN THE EXCAVATION WHICH WAS QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED WITH A PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHER. FDNY WAS ON LOCATION AND NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED AT THAT TIME. SUPERVISION REPORTED FROM LOCATION AN UNIDENTIFIED ELECTRIC FACILITY MAY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED WITH A DIGGING BAR AS A SUSPECTED SOURCE OF THE IGNITION. AT 14:09, TWO GAS CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYEES AND ONE COMPANY CONTRACTOR (PETMAR CO.)  EMPLOYEE WERE TRANSPORTED VIA EMS TO JACOBI MEDICAL CENTER WITH SUSPECTED 1ST DEGREE BURNS TO THEIR FACES, AND ONE GAS CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYEE WAS TRANSPORTED BY HIS SUPERVISOR TO THE SAME HOSPITAL DUE TO SUSPECTED BURNS TO THE FACE AS WELL.     MULTIPLE INTERNAL COMPANY DEPARTMENTS WERE NOTIFIED. FIRE BANK LOCATIONS ON THE NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST CORNERS OF EAST 188 STREET WERE IDENTIFIED TO CUT AND CAP THE GAS MAIN AND GAS DISTRIBUTION ENGINEERING DETERMINED THERE WOULD BE NO NEGATIVE SYSTEM IMPACT OR CUSTOMER OUTAGES AS A RESULT OF THE 6"" LOW PRESSURE  MAIN ISOLATION. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS DE-ENERGIZED THE ELECTRIC FEEDER SUSPECTED TO HAVE BEEN DAMAGED (FEEDER 3X71) AND FIRE BANKS WERE EXCAVATED, THE MAIN WAS TAPPED AND AT 18:17 STOPPERS WERE INSTALLED ISOLATING THE AFFECTED SEGMENT OF MAIN. AT 19:03, THE MAIN WAS CUT AND CAPPED AND BOTH END CAPS WERE INSTALLED AND AT 19:16, GDS REPORTED THAT ALL GAS READINGS DISSIPATED. IT WAS REPORTED AT 17:04, THAT ALL FOUR INJURED PERSONNEL WERE RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL WITH FIRST AID TREATMENT ONLY.     THE INITIAL EXCAVATION, MADE IN THE ROADWAY OFF THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION, WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN A LARGE PIECE OF CONCRETE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BECOME DISLODGED FROM THE ROADWAY PAVEMENT.  THAT EXCAVATION, AND OTHERS MADE TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK, ALSO CONTAINED VISIBLE VOIDS IN THE SUBSURFACE SOIL CAUSED BY THE LEAKING WATER MAIN.  BEFORE THE DEP MADE REPAIRS TO THE WATER MAIN THE LEAKING WATER WAS HEARD FLOWING IN A CATCH BASIN LOCATED AT THE NORTHERLY CURB OF E 188TH STREET. THE STREET VOIDS UNDER THE PAVEMENT CAUSED THE LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN TO CRACK AND RELEASE NATURAL GAS.    SIGNIFICANT MEDIA COVERAGE WAS REPORTED ON LOCATION INCLUDING CHANNEL 4, CHANNEL 7, CHANNEL 11 AND NEWS12.     THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, N.Y.S.

THE SERVICE WAS EXCAVATED BY THE CREW FORMAN. THE WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) ON THE CREW RETIRED THE SERVICE BY CUTTING THE SERVICE ABOUT 4 INCHES FROM THE TAPPING TEE WITH A SET OF FOUR WHEEL CUTTERS, AND THEN INSERTED A LEAK SCREW IN THE SERVICE, AND WELDED IT UP.  AFTER WELDING THE LEAK SCREW IN, THEY CHECKED FOR LEAKS AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND. WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) THEN BUFFED THE TEE AND MAIN OFF WITH A BUFFER TO PREPARE IT TO BE RE-COATED AND CHECKED FOR LEAKS A SECOND TIME. AFTER CHECKING FOR LEAKS AGAIN WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) FOUND A SMALL LEAK ON THE TAPPING TEE. WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) TRIED TO WELD THE LEAK UP BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. AFTER FAILING TO REPAIR THE LEAK ON THE TAPPING TEE THE CREW FORMAN INSTRUCTED WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) TO REMOVE THE TAPPING TEE AND INSTALL A LEAK SCREW IN THE MAIN TO ELIMINATE THE LEAK. WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) USED AN ELECTRIC BAND SAW TO CUT THE TEE OFF THE MAIN. WHILE CUTTING THE TEE OFF THE MAIN THE GAS IGNITED, AND WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) ESCAPED OUT OF THE HOLE WHILE RECEIVING BURNS TO HIS LEFT ARM, NECK, AND FACE.  IN THE PRECONSTRUCTION MEETING, THE GAS DISTRIBUTION/CONSTRUCTION SUPERINTENDENT INSTRUCTED THE CREW FORMAN NOT TO USE THE ELECTRIC BAND SAW WHILE RETIRING THIS SERVICE. THE DISTRIBUTION/CONSTRUCTION SUPERINTENDENT TOLD THE CREW FORMAN THIS WHILE GIVING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DAY OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2015. THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS CONVERSATION.   AT 11:26AM THE CREW FORMAN CALLED THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR AND TOLD HIM THAT WELDER 1 THE INJURED EMPLOYEE HAD RECEIVED BURNS AND THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR ARRIVED WITHIN FIVE MINUTES, AND TOOK WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. SERVICE WORKER A CALLED WELDER 2 WHO ARRIVED WITH IN TWENTY MINUTES TO THE JOB SITE. WELDER 2 INSTALLED AND WELDED A LEAK SCREW IN THE MAIN TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS. GAS WAS RELEASED FOR NO MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES.   AT APPROXIMATELY 12:05PM IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE INJURED EMPLOYEE WOULD NEED HOSPITALIZATION AND WAS TRANSFERRED TO GRADY HOSPITAL IN ATLANTA AROUND 1:30PM.  THE INJURED EMPLOYEE WAS HOSPITALIZED, NO PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND NO EVACUATIONS.  THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR CONTACTED CHRIS SWAN WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AT 12:39PM AS PER COMMISSION RULE.  THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR CONTACTED THE OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 1:50PM AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT.

THERE WAS A SEVERED NATURAL GAS PIPE INSIDE OF THE GARAGE AND GAS WAS FREE FLOWING INSIDE OF THE GARAGE, WHICH PROVIDED THE FUEL FOR THE IGNITION. THE AREA OF ORIGIN CONTAINED MULTIPLE COMPETENT AND POTENTIAL SOURCES OF ACCIDENTAL IGNITION. THESE INCLUDED ENERGIZED ELECTRICAL DEVICES. AS A RESULT, THE SPECIFIC SOURCE OF IGNITION OF THIS FIRE COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS INVESTIGATION. DURING THIS INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, NO SOURCES OF INCENDIARY IGNITION WERE OBSERVED OR INDICATED IN THE AREA OF ORIGIN.

THE PROPERTY WAS UNOCCUPIED AND NO INJURIES OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.     AFTER THE INCIDENT, CONSUMERS ENERGY CONDUCTED BAR HOLE TESTING IN THE VICINITY OF 10218 DODGE ROAD.   THIS TESTING INDICATED THAT GAS HAD MIGRATED FROM THE LEAK LOCATION AT 10209 DODGE ROAD ALONG THE MAIN TO A LOCATION APPROXIMATELY 20' WEST OF THE IDENTIFIED LEAK.   THE HIGHEST SUSTAINED READS WERE OBTAINED APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET FROM THE LEAK LOCATION AND APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET FROM THE BUILDING WALL.  THE INITIAL READ TAKEN AT 16:00, APPROXIMATELY 3.5 HOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSION WAS 55%.  A READ TAKEN AT THE SAME LOCATION 2 HOURS LATER (22%) INDICATES THE MIGRATING GAS WAS VENTING AT THIS LOCATION.  THIS LOCATION WAS MONITORED THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND CONTINUED TO VENT. LOWER RESIDUAL GAS READINGS WERE ALSO OBTAINED, BUT AT NO TIME (PRE OR POST-INCIDENT) WERE THERE ANY GAS READINGS AT THE BUILDING WALL OF 10218 DODGE ROAD.      BASED ON THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION SUMMARIZE ABOVE AND OUR INABILITY TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CUSTOMER'S FUEL LINE AND GAS APPLIANCE(S), CONSUMERS ENERGY FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT 10218 DODGE RD., WAS THE RESULT OF A RELEASE  AND/OR MIGRATION OF CONSUMERS ENERGY'S JURISDICTIONAL GAS."

BETWEEN 2115 AND 2130, THE MACHINE STRUCK A HAWAII GAS (""HG"") UNDERGROUND MAIN LINE, CAUSING AN APPROXIMATELY 9.5-INCH TEAR IN THE MAIN.  THE DAMAGED SEGMENT WAS 4-INCH STEEL PIPE COATED WITH XTC (""SUBJECT SEGMENT""). THE SUBJECT SEGMENT BEGAN TO LEAK GAS AND AT AN UNVERIFIED TIME, THE GAS IGNITED AROUND THE MACHINE. TWO RB EMPLOYEES WERE INJURED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRE AND ONE REQUIRED INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION. THE HONOLULU FIRE DEPARTMENT (""HFD"") RESPONDED AND DIRECTED WATER AT THE MACHINE TO PREVENT ITS FUEL TANKS FROM OVERHEATING. HG STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE SUBJECT SEGMENT AT APPROXIMATELY 0253 ON 06/16/2015, THE FIRE DISSIPATED SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND HFD ANNOUNCED AN ""ALL CLEAR"" AT APPROXIMATELY 0300.    HG PRE-INCIDENT ACTIVITY    HG INSTALLED THE SUBJECT SEGMENT IN 1977. ON 02/09/2015, RB SUBMITTED ONE CALL TICKET 15001196 (THE ""TICKET"") TO THE HAWAII ONE CALL CENTER STATING THAT RB WOULD BE EXCAVATING AN AREA OF KAPAHULU AVENUE (THE ""EXCAVATION AREA""), INCLUDING THE SUBJECT SEGMENT. HG RESPONDED TO THE TICKET BY REVIEWING EXCAVATION AREA MAPS AND DETERMINING THAT AN UNDERGROUND MAIN WAS LOCATED THEREIN. ON 02/19/2015, HG PERFORMED CONDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE TONING IN THE EXCAVATION AREA AND MARKED THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LINE ON THE ROADWAY SURFACE WITH YELLOW PAINT.    HG RESPONSE TO INCIDENT    HG WAS ALERTED TO THE INCIDENT IN TWO WAYS: 1) THE HG SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS PLANT RECORDED A PRESSURE IRREGULARITY IN THE GAS PIPELINE AND NOTIFIED HG DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 2130; AND 2) HFD NOTIFIED HG DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 2138. AN HG OPERATIONS SUPERINTENDENT ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 2200. OTHER HG PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED BETWEEN 2145 AND 2215, AND BEGAN ARRIVING AT THE HG KAMAKEE BASEYARD BETWEEN 2215 AND 2300. THE HG SUPERVISORY TEAM CONCLUDED THAT THE MAIN LINE WOULD NEED TO BE EXCAVATED AND STOPPED AT THREE LOCATIONS: NORTH, SOUTH AND WEST OF THE INCIDENT. HG PERSONNEL INSTALLED LINE STOPPERS AT THE NORTH AND SOUTH SITES AND PINCHED THE LINE AT THE WEST SITE. GAS FLOW TO THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS STOPPED AT APPROXIMATELY 0253 ON 06/16/15.    STATUTORY AND REGULATORY CONTEXT    (1) HAWAII ONE CALL STATUTE    THE HAWAII ONE CALL STATUTE REQUIRES AN EXCAVATOR TO PROVIDE EXCAVATION LOCATION TO THE ONE CALL CENTER PRIOR TO EXCAVATING, AND THE CENTER NOTIFIES UTILITY OPERATORS ABOUT THE PROPOSED EXCAVATION. THE OPERATOR LOCATES AND MARKS ON THE ROADWAY THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF INSTALLATIONS THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE EXCAVATION, BUT IS NOT REQUIRED TO MARK DEPTH UNDER THE STATUTE. THE EXCAVATOR MUST THEN USE HAND TOOLS TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE INSTALLATION. HERE, HG RESPONDED TO THE TICKET BY REVIEWING MAPS, PERFORMING TONING AND MARKING THE ALIGNMENT--BUT NOT DEPTH--OF THE GAS MAIN IN THE EXCAVATION AREA WITH YELLOW PAINT. HG WAS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE ONE CALL STATUTE. RB DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE HAND EXCAVATED AND LOCATED THE SUBJECT SEGMENT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTE.    (2) SUBJECT SEGMENT DEPTH    FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN 1977 REQUIRED 24-INCH COVER FOR A MAIN LINE. A MAIN LINE CAN BE INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER IF AN UNDERGROUND STRUCTURE PREVENTS SUCH INSTALLATION AND THE LINE IS PROVIDED WITH ADDITIONAL PROTECTION. ON 06/16/2015, THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS MEASURED AT APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES BELOW THE ROADWAY SURFACE. IF THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER IN 1977, THE ABOVE EXCEPTION APPLIES. CITY RECORDS INDICATE THAT A CONDUIT STRUCTURE RUNS DIRECTLY BELOW THE SUBJECT SEGMENT, PREVENTING INSTALLATION OF THE SUBJECT SEGMENT AT 24-INCH DEPTH. THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS ENCASED IN CONCRETE, PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION REQUIRED FOR MAINS INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER.    PLEASE CONTACT HG FOR ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE DETAIL IN PDF FORMAT."

A GAS EMERGENCY MECHANIC WAS DISPATCHED AT 22:52 HOURS TO INVESTIGATE AND FOUND NO INDICATIONS OF GAS IN THE WATER VALVE BOX.  ON MAY 9, 2015 AT 1:18 HOURS, ANOTHER GAS EMERGENCY MECHANIC WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE AND ALSO FOUND NO INDICATIONS OF NATURAL GAS IN THE WATER VALVE BOX.  AT 13:37 HOURS, THE NYCDEP REPORTED TO THE GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER (GERC) THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING GAS READINGS IN THE WATER VALVE BOX, WHICH HAD BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY BACKFILLED.  A GAS EMERGENCY MECHANIC RESPONDED, INVESTIGATED AND REPORTED A 7% GAS READING IN THE WATER VALVE BOX.  CON EDISON'S CHEMICAL LAB PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION AND AT 20:32 HOURS THEY REPORTED FINDING A CONCENTRATION OF 5.9% NATURAL GAS-IN-AIR IN THE WATER VALVE BOX.   CON EDISON DISPATCHED AN EMERGENCY CONSTRUCTION CREW TO RESPOND, VENTILATE AND INVESTIGATE FOR A POSSIBLE GAS LEAK.  THE LEAK INVESTIGATION REVEALED POSITIVE GAS READINGS OVER A 16"" LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON GAS MAIN, LOCATED IN THE ROADWAY APPROXIMATELY 50' WEST AND 15' SOUTH OF THE WATER VALVE BOX. A LEAKING HUB ON THE 16"" MAIN WAS EXPOSED AND SEALED.  A RETIRED, OUT-OF-SERVICE 8"" STEEL GAS MAIN ON THE NORTH SIDE OF EAST 54TH STREET BETWEEN LEXINGTON AND THIRD AVENUES WAS EXPOSED AND FOUND TO CONTAIN 90% GAS-IN-AIR.  THE LEAK INVESTIGATION FOUND POSITIVE GAS READINGS NEAR THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF EAST 54 STREET AND THIRD AVENUE IN THE AREA OF A 16"" LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON GAS MAIN.  THREE HUB CONNECTIONS ON THAT 16"" LOW PRESSURE GAS MAIN WERE EXCAVATED, FOUND TO BE LEAKING AND WERE REPAIRED.  THE AREA WAS MONITORED, CONFIRMED CLEAR AND NO ADDITIONAL READINGS WERE DETECTED.

(""COLUMBIA"" OR ""COMPANY"") SERVICE TECHNICIAN RESPONDED TO AN ODOR-OF-GAS CALL AT 3418 SUNNINGDALE WAY, UPPER ARLINGTON, OHIO. THE TECHNICIAN VERIFIED THAT NO ONE WAS AT HOME, AND TURNED OFF BOTH THE CURB VALVE TO THE ACTIVE SERVICE LINE AND THE METER VALVE. NO LEAKS WERE FOUND IN THE METER SET ASSEMBLY, BUT SUBSURFACE READINGS INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF GAS AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE.     WHILE THE TECHNICIAN WAS ON THE PREMISES, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED, FOLLOWED BY A FIRE. THE FIRE CONTINUED AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE. ALTHOUGH THE FIRE APPEARED TO BE GAS-FED, IT CONTINUED AFTER THE COMPANY PHYSICALLY DISCONNECTED THE ACTIVE, PLASTIC SERVICE LINE. IN THE COURSE OF SEARCHING FOR POSSIBLE SOURCES OF THE FIRE, THE COMPANY DISCOVERED A DISCONTINUED CUSTOMER-OWNED STEEL SERVICE LINE, WHICH WAS ACCESSED THROUGH A CURB BOX THAT WAS INCORRECTLY LABELED ""WATER."" THE VALVE ON THAT LINE WAS PARTIALLY OPEN, AND THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WAS INADVERTENTLY OPERATED BY A THIRD PARTY ON THE PREVIOUS DAY. THE LINE TERMINATED AT AN ELBOW APPROXIMATELY 38 INCHES BELOW THE SURFACE, NEAR THE BLOCK FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE. SUBSEQUENT TESTING SHOWED A CORROSION LEAK APPROXIMATELY FOUR FEET FROM THE INCORRECTLY LABELED CURB BOX, AND ADDITIONAL EXAMINATION OF THAT FACILITY REVEALED THAT THE ELBOW AT THE TERMINATION OF THE DISCONTINUED CUSTOMER-OWNED SERVICE LINE WAS UNCAPPED. COLUMBIA'S RECORDS DO NOT SHOW TWO SERVICE LINES AT THIS ADDRESS, AND SUBSEQUENT GAS MAIN CAMERA INSPECTIONS, INCLUDING GAS LINE VALVES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE CONNECTIONS TO THE MAIN, CONDUCTED BY COLUMBIA ON SUNNINGDALE WAY AND THE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING STREETS CONFIRMED THAT THE DISCONTINUED AND CONNECTED GAS SERVICE LINE IS AN ANOMALY BECAUSE ALL OTHER GAS MAIN OPENINGS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE COMPANY'S RECORDS. THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO RULE OUT AN UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION OF FACILITIES BY A THIRD PARTY.     AT THIS POINT IN THE INVESTIGATION, COLUMBIA HAS ENOUGH INFORMATION TO FINALIZE ITS INCIDENT REPORT, AND SUBMITS THAT THE INADVERTENT OPERATION OF A GAS VALVE BY A THIRD-PARTY, WHICH WAS ACCESSED THROUGH A CURB BOX THAT WAS INCORRECTLY LABELED ""WATER,"" WHICH ULTIMATELY ALLOWED GAS TO FLOW TO A DISCONTINUED, UNCAPPED SERVICE LINE IS THE LIKELY SERIES OF EVENTS THAT CAUSED THE INCIDENT.

ON CYPRESS LANE IN STAFFORD. AT 9:05 A.M. NEW JERSEY NATURAL GAS (""NJNG"") RECEIVED THE FIRST OF SEVERAL ""NO GAS"" CALLS. THE COMPANY SENT A CREW TO THE AREA. BEFORE THEY REACHED CYPRESS LANE, THE CREW WAS FLAGGED DOWN BY A POLICE OFFICER AT THE INTERSECTION OF OAK AVENUE AND ROUTE 9, WHO INFORMED THEM THAT THERE WAS A GAS ODOR ON OAK AVENUE. THEREAFTER, AT 9:15 A.M. A FIRST RESPONDER WAS DISPATCHED TO OAK AVENUE AND ARRIVED AT ABOUT 9:24 A.M. A STRONG GAS ODOR WAS IDENTIFIED NEAR 59 OAK AVENUE. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT NO ONE WAS IN THE BUILDING. POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL WERE ALREADY ON SITE AND HAD EVACUATED NEIGHBORING HOMES.  SOON THEREAFTER, THREE ADDITIONAL CREWS ARRIVED AT 59 OAK AVENUE. A LEAK IN THE STREET WAS LOCATED AND THE CREWS BEGAN JACKHAMMERING THE PAVEMENT. AT 10:32 A.M., AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED INSIDE 59 OAK AVENUE. PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT APPROXIMATELY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WERE EVACUATED BY FIRE AND POLICE. A REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE WAS MADE IMMEDIATELY. SEVEN NJNG EMPLOYEES WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. FIVE WERE TREATED AND RELEASED AND TWO WERE ADMITTED. THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE AT 11:30 A.M. BY SHUTTING A VALVE TO THE STREET, WHICH AFFECTED ABOUT 335 CUSTOMERS. AT 14:30 (2:30 P.M.), NJNG RECEIVED PERMISSION TO RE-ENTER THE AREA AND REMOVE DEBRIS. THE STREET WAS OPENED IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE LEAK WAS FOUND AND A TWO-INCH (2"") COATED STEEL MAIN WAS FOUND TO BE BROKEN AT THE WELD JOINT. THE BREAK WAS 360 AROUND THE PIPE AND THE PIPE ENDS WERE SEPARATED. APPROXIMATELY TWO FEET OF PIPE ON EACH SIDE OF THE BREAK WAS REMOVED FOR METALLURGICAL EVALUATION.   NJNG BELIEVES THAT THERE WERE THREE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING CAUSES FOR THE FAILURE:  (I) A POOR QUALITY WELD, LACKING ADEQUATE PENETRATION; (II) ENVIRONMENTALLY ASSISTED CRACKING OF THE WELD (E.G., CORROSION); AND (III) EXTERNAL STRESS ON THE GAS MAIN, POSSIBLY FROM POST-INSTALLATION IMPACT, DIFFERENTIAL SOIL SETTLEMENT BELOW THE PIPE, SOIL DISPLACEMENT FROM ADJACENT CONSTRUCTION, ETC.     WITH REFERENCE TO QUESTION NUMBER 2 IN PART D ABOVE, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT NJNG HAS RECEIVED NUMEROUS PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, INCLUDING THE OWNER OF 59 OAK AVENUE, IN THE AMOUNT OF $199,000 AND SEVEN NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $75,000.  THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED NOTICE OF OTHER CLAIMS FROM OTHER INSURANCE CARRIERS BUT THESE CARRIERS HAVE NOT INDICATED A LOSS AMOUNT.  THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE COMPANY ULTIMATELY PAYS ON THESE CLAIMS WILL DEPEND ON A FINDING OF LIABILITY AGAINST THE COMPANY AS WELL AS WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGES CLAIMED CAN BE PROVEN BY THE CLAIMANT AND VERIFIED BY THE COMPANY.   A NEW PLASTIC MAIN WAS INSTALLED AND PRESSURIZED ON FEBRUARY 25, 2015 AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 A.M. SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO ALL CUSTOMERS ON FEBRUARY 25, 2015 BY 18:30 (6:30 P.M.).  SUBSEQUENTLY THE ENTIRE 2"" STEEL MAIN AND THE 2""HDPE MAIN HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH 4"" HDPE PIPE. THIS INSTALLATION WAS COMPLETED OCTOBER 27, 2015"

AFTER THE RELIEF VALVE OPENED, THE VALVE FAILED TO RE-SEAT DUE TO A PIECE OF WELD SLAG ON THE SEAT OF THE RELIEF.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE INCIDENT, AND BEFORE RETURNING THE STATION TO SERVICE, A DEDICATED FILTER WAS PLACED IN FRONT OF THE REGULATORS TO THE INSTRUMENT GAS TO MINIMIZE THE PROBABILITY OF RE-OCCURRENCE.

INCIDENT DESCRIPTION:  ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2014, MILLER PIPELINE CORP., A CONTRACTOR PERFORMING WORK FOR ATMOS ENERGY LOUISIANA DIVISION, WAS SCHEDULED TO DEACTIVATE AND ABANDON A 4"" PE GAS LINE ON HWY 21 @ N. AZALEA IN COVINGTON, LA. THIS WAS A COOL DAY WITH LOW HUMIDITY.    MILLER PIPELINE EMPLOYEE ANTHONY DUNCAN (CREW FOREMAN) WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS WORK AND WAS QUALIFIED IN THE ASSOCIATED OQ TASKS.  - ALL LINE STOPPERS UTILIZED TO BLOCK THE SOURCE OF GAS WERE INSTALLED PREVIOUSLY.  - BEFORE BEGINNING THE PURGING PROCESS, MR. DUNCAN CHECKED TO MAKE SURE ALL SOURCES OF GAS WERE BLOCKED FROM THE GAS LINE TO BE DEACTIVATED.  - AFTER CONFIRMATION THAT ALL SOURCES OF GAS WERE BLOCKED, MR. DUNCAN PROCEEDED TO OPEN THE VALVE (ON PURGE RISER) TO BEGIN DE-PRESSURING AND BLOWING DOWN THE GAS FROM THE LINE. HE WAITED 15 - 20 MINUTES FOR THE LINE TO BLOW DOWN.  - ONCE HE THOUGHT THE LINE WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN DOWN, MR. DUNCAN GOT IN THE EXCAVATION TO REMOVE THE BLOW DOWN RISER. HE USED 2-INCH PLASTIC CUTTERS TO PERFORM THIS TASK. IT WAS DURING THIS PROCESS THAT THE RESIDUAL GAS IN THE PIPE IGNITED AND A FLASH FIRE OCCURRED INJURING MR. DUNCAN.  - MR. DUNCAN WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS HELD OVERNIGHT FOR TREATMENT AND OBSERVATION.    CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT:  IT SEEMS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE GAS LINE TO BE ABANDONED WAS NOT PURGED OF GAS PROPERLY, ALLOWING RESIDUAL GAS TO REMAIN IN THE LINE. SECONDLY, PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL IGNITION WERE NOT FOLLOWED BY NOT PROPERLY GROUNDING THE PIPE OR TOOLS PRIOR TO CUTTING THE PURGE RISER. STATIC ELECTRICITY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF IGNITION OF THE RESIDUAL GAS. THIRDLY, MR. DUNCAN WAS NOT WEARING THE PROPER PPE (PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT) FIRE RETARDANT CLOTHING/GLOVES. THIS ADDED PROTECTION COULD HAVE MINIMIZED THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES. FOURTHLY, MR. DUNCAN SENT HIS HELPER (ON FIRE WATCH) AWAY TO PERFORM ANOTHER JOB DUTY. BY HAVING SOMEONE ON FIRE WATCH AT THE EXCAVATION WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER COULD ALSO HAVE MINIMIZED THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES, BY EITHER EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE RIGHT AWAY OR PULLING MR. DUNCAN OUT OF THE EXCAVATION AND AWAY FROM THE FIRE.     ROOT CAUSE:  THERE SEEMS TO BE HUMAN ERROR IN JUDGMENT BY MR. DUNCAN IN SEVERAL INSTANCES INVOLVING FOLLOWING PROCEDURES AND SAFETY POLICIES; THE BELOW FACTORS IN COMBINATION RELATED TO THE CAUSE OF THE FLASH FIRE WHICH RESULTED IN THE INCIDENT:  - DID NOT PURGE NATURAL GAS FROM DEACTIVATED LINE BY USING AIR OR NITROGEN GAS;  - DID NOT CHECK FOR COMPLETE PURGING (0% GAS) OF NATURAL GAS WITH A CGI (COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR) FROM THE PURGE RISER;  - DID NOT PRACTICE PREVENTING STATIC ELECTRICITY HAZARD BY USING SOAPY WATER OR ANTI-STATIC SPRAY AND BURLAP SACK ON PLASTIC PIPE AND ALSO GROUNDING TOOLS PRIOR TO CUTTING PURGE RISER FROM DEACTIVATED PIPE.  THIS ALONG WITH RESIDUAL GAS IN THE DEACTIVATED PIPE RESULTED IN A FLASH FIRE WHICH CAUSED THE INJURY.  - DID NOT WEAR PROPER PPE (PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT); FIRE RETARDANT CLOTHING AND GLOVES.  - DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER WORKER AT PURGE LOCATION ON FIRE WATCH WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.     THE ABOVE INSTANCES (WHICH WERE NOT FOLLOWED) ARE COVERED IN ATMOS ENERGY'S O&M PROCEDURES AND SAFETY MANUAL; THEY ARE ALSO COVERED UNDER OQ TASKS L2 - ACTIVATING AND PURGING PIPELINES AND M8 - PREVENTING ACCIDENTAL IGNITION."

A THIRD PARTY (GM ENGINEERING) STRUCK A 2-INCH PLASTIC DISTRIBUTION MAIN (NEAR A 3-WAY TEE, WHICH BRANCHES OFF A 4-INCH PLASTIC DISTRIBUTION MAIN) WITH A BACKHOE, CAUSING AN UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS. THE THIRD PARTY CALLED USA (NO. 459722) ON 11/3/2014.  PG&E RECEIVED THE NORMAL NOTICE ON 11/03/2014 (11:25:55 AM).  IN RESPONSE TO THE TICKET, PG&E ATTEMPTED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE EXCAVATOR BEFORE LOCATING AND MARKING ITS FACILITIES.  PG&E LEFT A MESSAGE FOR THE EXCAVATOR ON 11/5/2014 BUT DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM THE EXCAVATOR TO COORDINATE THE LOCATE AND MARK PRIOR TO THE EXCAVATION. (AS IS CUSTOMARY FOR LARGE EXCAVATION PROJECTS, PG&E COMMUNICATES WITH THE EXCAVATORS TO PHASE THE MARKING OF PG&E FACILITIES TO ENSURE MARKINGS REMAIN VISIBLE IN THE EXCAVATION AREA.) A PG&E GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (GSR) ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 1131 HOURS. PG&E REPAIR CREW ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 1140 HOURS.  GAS WAS COMPLETELY SHUT IN AT 1702 HOURS BY CLOSING 10 DISTRIBUTION MAIN VALVES AND ISOLATING APPROXIMATELY 4 BLOCKS OF THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND 40 CUSTOMERS. PG&E INITIALLY PLANNED TO SAFELY SQUEEZE THE 2-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC PIPE AT A LOCATION AWAY FROM THE PERIPHERY OF THE DIG-IN LOCATION. UPON FURTHER EVALUATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT DIGGING AND SQUEEZING THE LINE WOULD TAKE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME DUE TO THE DEPTH EXCEEDING 5 FEET AND THE NEED TO INSTALL SHORING TO COMPLETE THIS WORK. ONCE PG&E ESTIMATED THE TOTAL TIME REQUIRED FOR THE SHUT-IN, PG&E DECIDED TO LOOK FOR AN ALTERNATIVE THAT INCLUDED CLOSING VALVES IN THE SURROUNDING AREA THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE CUSTOMER OUTAGES.  PG&E DETERMINED THAT CLOSING VALVES WAS THE FASTEST AND SAFEST METHOD AND CHOSE TO CLOSE NEARBY VALVES FOR SHUTTING IN GAS FLOW. REPAIR CREW REPLACED THE 4X4X2-INCH TEE AND THE DAMAGED 2-INCH DISTRIBUTION MAIN. ABOUT 2,500 PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM OFFICE BUILDINGS ON A TWO-BLOCK AREA OF MARKET AND FIRST AND SAN PEDRO STREETS. SANTA CLARA STREET WAS CLOSED BETWEEN FIRST AND SAN PEDRO STREETS, ACCORDING TO THE VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. BUS LINES 22, 522, 68, 17, 168, AND 181 WERE REROUTED, VTA OFFICIALS SAID. SEVERAL SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA NEWS STATIONS WERE OBSERVED ON SCENE (I.E., KTVU, NBC BAY AREA). THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE CPUC AND DOT DUE TO THE ESTIMATED DAMAGES EXPECTED TO EXCEED $50,000 AND MAJOR MEDIA OBSERVED ON SCENE."

NEITHER OF THESE REPORTS CAN BE CONFIRMED AT THIS TIME (09:19 ON 11/4/14).    SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE UPDATE 11/18/14:  THE HOMEOWNER DETECTED LEAKING NATURAL GAS IN THE GARAGE AND EXITED THE GARAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WHEN THE GAS IGNITED FROM UNKOWN SOURCES. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE GAS ESCAPED THE MAIN UNDER THE PAVING IN THE STREET WHERE IT WAS IN CONTACT WITH A STEEL CONDUIT FOR AN AT&T PHONE CALBE AND A STEEL CONDUIT FOR THE ELECTRIC SERVICE TO THE HOUSE. THE ESCAPING GAS TRAVELED THROUGH HOLES IN THE GAS MAIN AND THE PHONE CONDUIT CREATED BY ELECTRICAL ARC BURNS. THE GAS ENTERED 417 PRIMAVERA VIA THE PHONE CONDUIT INTO THE GARAGE.    THREE PERSONS WERE TRANSPORTED TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL AND ALL WERE EXAMINED AND RELEASED. THE 82 YEAR OLD HOMEOWNER WAS TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES AND RELEASED. HIS WIFE WAS ALSO CHECKED OUT AND RELEASED. ONE FIREFIGHTER WAS TREATED FOR A KNEE INJURY SUSTAINED WHEN SHE TRIPPED OVER HOSE LINE AND RELEASED.    UPON A PRESSURE TEST OF THE MAIN AND SERVICES ON THE STREET, ADDITIONAL ARC BURNS WERE DETECTED IN A 3/4"" PE SERIVCE IN THE STREET NEAR THE CONDUITS. THE 3"" BS GAS MAIN WAS INSERTED WITH 2"" PE AND THE SERVICES WERE REPAIRED AND ALL THE AFFECTED FACILITIES WERE PRESSURE TESTED AGAIN AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE REMAINING HOUSES ON THE STREET ON 11/6/2014.     AT&T HAS ALSO REPLACED THE PHONE CABLE IN THE STREET AND ABANDONED THE STEEL CONDUIT BY 11/17/2014.    FINAL - UPDATED NARRATIVE 2/25/15  A JOPINT INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTY WAS CONDUCTED ON 12/4/2014 BY INVESTIGATORS FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT AND FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILITIES. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NATURAL GAS ENTERED THE GARAGE VIA A PHONE CONDUIT. THE GAS IGNITED IN THE GARAGE AND FUELED THE FIRE. IT WAS NOT DETERMINED HOW THE GAS ENTERED THE PHONE CONDUIT. A METALURGICAL INSPECTION OF THE STEEL PHONE CONDUIT AND GAS PIPE THAT WAS REMOVED FROM THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WILL BE CONDUCTED AT THE FACILITIES OF SEA LIMITED, INC.

AT APPROXIMATELY 9:26 P.M. ON 10/1/2014, DOMINION EAST OHIO RECEIVED AN ODOR COMPLAINT AT 7373 SHERMAN CHURCH RD.  A TECHNICIAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA.  AT 9:48 P.M. THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED ON SITE, CONDUCTED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE AREA AND CONCLUDED THAT GAS WAS NOT MIGRATING AND ACCORDING TO AVAILABLE DATA DID NOT BELIEVE THE LEAK TO BE ON A DOMINION FACILITY.  THE TECHNICIAN NOTIFIED THE FIRE CHIEF OF HIS FINDINGS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:55 P.M. DOMINION WAS NOTIFIED BY THE EPA THAT OIL WAS BUBBLING UP FROM THE GROUND AND THAT THEY WERE PICKING UP HIGH NATURAL GAS READINGS.  ANOTHER TECHNICIAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE, ARRIVED AT 12:47 A.M. ON 10/2/2014, AND UPON INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT DEO'S 30"" DISTRIBUTION LINE WAS LEAKING AND CALLED IN FOR A CONSTRUCTION CREW.  THE TECHNICIAN CONTINUED TO LEAK SURVEY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.  AS ADDITIONAL DOMINION PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE, THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED AND DETERMINED THAT THE LINE WAS DEEPER THAN A DOMINION CREW COULD HANDLE, THEREFORE A CONTRACTING CREW WAS MOBILIZED.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 A.M. DOMINION'S ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRACTORS ARRIVED ON SITE AND BEGAN ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP ACTIVITIES.  THE AREA WAS EVACUATED AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 A.M.  AS MEASURE OF SAFETY, BEFORE EXCAVATING COULD OCCUR DOMINION DECIDED TO LOWER THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 AM THE PRESSURE WAS LOWERED FROM 155 PSIG TO 60 PSIG.  ONCE THE PRESSURE WAS STABILIZED DOMINION BEGAN EXCAVATING.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 P.M. A CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND PRESSURE RESTORED.      THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT LEAKED WAS CUT OUT AND SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR A 3RD PARTY FAILURE ANALYSIS.  THE RESULTS OF THE TEST CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS A THROUGH-WALL INTERNAL CORROSION PIT AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.  TEST RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MICROBIAL-INDUCED CORROSION (MIC) PLAYED A ROLE IN THE PITTING CORROSION.  DOMINION REPLACED APPROXIMATELY 800 FEET OF THE 30"" HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION LINE THAT LEAKED AND WILL REPLACE ADDITIONAL PORTIONS OF ADJACENT PIPELINES THROUGHOUT 2015."

CONSTRUCTION, A CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR CENTERPOINT ENERGY, WAS IN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING AN EXISTING 3/4"" STEEL SERVICE LINE TO AN INACTIVE ACCOUNT AT 37 KNIGHT DRIVE, NORTH LITTLE ROCK, AR.  A LOCATE WAS REQUESTED FROM THE ARKANSAS ONE CALL CENTER TO LOCATED ALL FACILITIES; HOWEVER THE CONTRACTOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCATING THE CENTERPOINT ENERGY FACILITIES.  EMPLOYEES OF J.F CONSTRUCTION USED A PIPE LOCATOR TO VERIFY THE LOCATION OF THE EXISTING SERVICE, FOUND IT TO NOT BE IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR PLANNED WORK, BUT DID NOT COMPLETELY MARK THE REMAINDER OF THE SERVICE LINE.  DUE TO THE LARGE TREES ON THE PROPERTY, THE ORIGINAL SERVICE LINE INSTALLATION DID NOT TAKE A PERPENDICULAR PATH FROM THE MAIN.  A PNEUMATIC BORING TOOL WAS PLACED IN A BELL HOLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSTALLING A NEW SERVICE.  AFTER BORING FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, THE TOOL STRUCK WHAT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE EXISTING SERVICE LINE. THE IMPACT FROM THE BORING TOOL BENT THE 3/4' STEEL SERVICE LINE AT THE IMPACT POINT, CAUSING A PARTIAL SEPARATION OF THE PIPE AT A THREADED COUPLING SIX FEET EAST OF THE MOBILE HOME AND ANOTHER LEAK OF UNDETERMINED NATURE UNDER THE MOBILE HOME. APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AFTER THE LEAK BEGAN, A SMALL EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AND THE RESULTING FLASH CAUSED SECOND-DEGREE BURNS TO THE RESIDENT INSIDE THE MOBILE HOME.  HYDRAULIC SQUEEZE TOOLS WERE USED TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS AND TO RETIRE/ABANDON THE SERVICE LINE. THE PIPELINE FACILITY (SERVICE LINE) REMAINS SHUT DOWN. HOWEVER, INSTALLATION OF A NEW SERVICE IS NOT ANTICIPATED. THEREFORE, WE ARE NOT PLANNING TO FILE A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.   CENTERPOINT ENERGY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS FROM THIS INCIDENT. WE ANTICIPATE ALL ASSOCIATED COSTS TO BE BORNE BY THE CONTRACTOR.    ALSO, SINCE WE HAVE NO ACCESS TO PROPERTY DAMAGE OR MEDICAL CLAIM INFORMATION, WE ARE ESTIMATING THESE TO BE $50,000."

PRIOR TO RE-PRESSURIZING THE MAIN, THE CREW PLACED A CONCRETE THRUST BLOCK AGAINST THE CAP THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE MAIN IN THE EXCAVATION. TWO EMPLOYEES WERE WORKING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE EXCAVATION ON A DEAD SECTION OF THE MAIN, PREPARING IT FOR INSERTION. AFTER THE LIVE SIDE HAD BEEN RE-PRESSURIZED TO LINE PRESSURE OF 22 PSIG, AN UNEXPOSED MECHANICAL JOINT FAILED, CAUSING THE SEGMENT OF THE LIVE MAIN TO DISLODGE.  AS A RESULT OF THE PRESSURE FROM THE SEPARATION, THE MAIN SEGMENT HIT AND PUSHED THE THRUST BLOCK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EXCAVATION, INJURING THE TWO EMPLOYEES. THE EMPLOYEES WERE TREATED AND RELEASED FROM A HOSPITAL THE SAME DAY, WITHOUT BEING FORMALLY ADMITTED.

THE WORK INVOLVED REPLACING A WEIGHTED LEVER REGULATOR WITH A WORKER/MONITOR REGULATOR SET STYLE OF STATION.    THE EXISTING REGULATOR WAS REMOVED AND NEW REGULATORS WERE INSTALLED.  ONCE INSTALLED, LEAKAGE WAS DISCOVERED ON THE NEW REGULATOR STATION PRE-ASSEMBLED PIPING.  THE NEW STATION REGULATORS WERE REMOVED TO MAKE REPAIRS.    WHILE REPAIRS WERE BEING MADE TO THE WORKER/MONITOR SET, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A FITTING USED FOR ONE OF THE CONTROL LINES WAS LEAKING.  A WELDER WAS REQUESTED AND DISPATCHED TO THE WORK SITE TO REPAIR THE LEAKING FITTING.    BLIND FLANGES WERE INSTALLED WHERE THE NEW WORKER/MONITOR SET HAD BEEN REMOVED AND TWO EMPLOYEES BEGAN MAKING A REPAIR TO THE LEAKING FITTING.  A WELD CONE WAS INSTALLED INTO THE LEAKING THREADED FITTING TO STOP THE LEAK PRIOR TO FINALIZING THE REPAIR.  DURING THE CONTAINMENT OF THE LEAKAGE, AS ADDITIONAL WORK WAS BEING CONDUCTED, A SMALL FLASH FIRE OCCURRED, CAUSING SUPERFICIAL BURNS TO ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES COMPLETING THE WORK IN THE VAULT.  THE INJURED EMPLOYEE WAS HOSPITALIZED OVERNIGHT TO HAVE HIS INJURIES EXAMINED AND TO CONFIRM THAT THE BURNS WERE EXTERNAL AND MINOR IN NATURE.

THIS RESPONSE REMAINS UNKNOWN.    PAGE 3, PART D LINE 2F.  WE HAVE SHOWN THE GAS LOST AS .07 MCF.  OUR COST OF GAS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WAS $6.5132.  THIS EQUATES TO A COST OF $.45.  SINCE WHOLE DOLLARS ARE REQUIRED, THE COST OF GAS LOST WAS $1.00.    PAGE 3, PART E, LINES 1-3.  THIS WAS A DISTRIBUTION LINE OPERATING AT 12 OUNCES.  BECAUSE THE PRESSURE MUST BE SHOWN AS PSIG, THE PRESSURE WOULD EQUATE TO .75 PSIG.  NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THESE LINES.    PAGE 4, PART G1.

THE EMPLOYEE HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO 4777 WELLINGTON DRIVE TO COMPLETE A LEAK INVESTIGATION ORDER THAT WAS CREATED AT 2152 HOURS. DURING THE LEAK INVESTIGATION, THE EMPLOYEE SMELLED AN ODOR AT THE CORNER OF WELLINGTON DRIVE AND TRENTON COURT AND DETECTED 0.3% LEL WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR (CGI).    THE EMPLOYEE NOTICED FERTILIZER AND MULCH IN THE AREA. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES AND TRAINING, THE EMPLOYEE ATTACHED A CHARCOAL FILTER TO THE CGI AND DETECTED 0.0% LEL WITH THE FILTER INSTALLED. THE EMPLOYEE WALKED TOWARDS 4773 TRENTON COURT WHEN THE RESIDENT OF THE AREA FLAGGED THE EMPLOYEE DOWN AND SHOUTED THAT THERE IS A FIRE IN THE RESIDENCE NEXT DOOR. THE EMPLOYEE STARTED TO DIAL 911 AND 4771 TRENTON COURT EXPLODED AT APPROXIMATELY 2243 HOURS.    NORTH SHORE GAS STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS BY CLOSING A SINGLE VALVE AT 0032 HOURS ON 4/26/14 AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LONG GROVE FIRE DEPARTMENT. TWO PEOPLE RECEIVED MEDICAL ATTENTION ONSITE AND WERE RELEASED. OTHER HOMES IN THE AREA WERE DAMAGED DUE TO THE EXPLOSION AND THE EXTENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.    THE GAS MAIN THAT FED 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 2"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1991. THE GAS SERVICE FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 1.125"" BLACK PLASTIC SERVICE THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1996. THE SERVICE DID NOT HAVE AN EXCESS FLOW VALVE AS IT WAS NOT REQUIRED BY CODE AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION. FOLLOWING THE EVENT, THE GAS MAIN AND ALL ASSOCIATED GAS SERVICE PIPES WERE PRESSURE TESTED ON 5/12/14.  THE MAINS AND SERVICES WERE PRESSURE TESTED AT 44 PSIG, THE PRESSURE IN THE LINES AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION FOR 1 HOUR.  ALL MAINS AND SERVICES HELD PRESSURE DEMONSTRATING NO LEAKAGE OUT OF THESE LINES. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION (ICC) PIPELINE SAFETY BRANCH WITNESSED THIS TESTING. THE 4"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN IN WELLINGTON DRIVE WAS RESTARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOURS ON 4/27/14.    THE RISER FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE ON 5/15/14 FOR AN X-RAY AND IS SCHEDULED TO BE PERFORMED ON 5/23/14. THE METER AND REGULATOR ARE NOT IN A CONDITION THAT CAN BE TESTED.    6/4/14: AN X-RAY TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE RISER PIPE ON 5/23/14 TO TEST THE MECHANICAL ASSEMBLY.     12/31/14: THE BORESCOPE PERFORMED ON 10/10/14 WAS INCONCLUSIVE. ON 11/3/14 THE RISER ASSEMBLY WAS PRESSURE TESTED AND DID NOT HOLD PRESSURE DUE TO EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE PLASTIC PIPE INSIDE THE RISER. THE HOME APPLIANCES ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING TESTED.    9/14/15: A RE-ASSEMBLY OF THE GAS SYSTEM INSIDE OF THE HOUSE IS BEING GENERATED. PGL IS PLANNING AN ADDITIONAL TEST ON THE RISER.    12/15/15: THE RE-ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF THE GAS SYSTEM INSIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS COMPLETED.    6/27/17: FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE RISER DETERMINED A STIFFENER HAD NOT BEEN INSTALLED IN THE SERVICE, AS WAS THE PRACTICE AT THE TIME THE SERVICE WAS INSTALLED. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE RISER WAS LEAKING OR THAT THERE WAS A PATH FOR THE GAS TO TRAVEL FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE INTO THE HOUSE IF GAS HAD BEEN PRESENT. THEREFORE, NSG HAS DETERMINED THAT JURISDICTIONAL GAS PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. THE EVENT WAS CAUSED BY CUSTOMER OWNED PIPING AND/OR EQUIPMENT INSIDE THE HOUSE.    NSG CONSIDERS THIS INCIDENT CLOSED."

UPON ARRIVAL, THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON SITE AND CONTROLLING THE SCENE.  NATURAL GAS APPEARED TO BE RELEASING IN THE GENERAL AREA OF THE GAS METER.  THE GAS WAS CONTROLLED BY SQUEEZE-OFF OF THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE AT 11:08 AM.  WASHINGTON GAS PERSONNEL CONDUCTED BAR/TEST IN THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT AND OBSERVED NO EVIDENCE OF GAS MIGRATION.  AN ODORANT SAMPLE WAS TAKEN AND THE LEVEL OF ODORANT WAS DETERMINED TO BE ACCEPTABLE.  A PRESSURE TEST WAS CONDUCTED ON THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE FROM THE SQUEEZE-OFF POINT TO THE UPPER END OF THE STEEL SERVICE RISER.  THE PRESSURE TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT OPERATING PRESSURE FOR 15 MINUTES.  THE SERVICE HELD THE PRESSURE TEST.  A FRACTURE WAS OBSERVED AT THE THREADED END OF THE RISER IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE STOPCOCK.  FOLLOW-UP ANALYSIS OF THE THREADED END OF THE RISER INDICATED THAT THE FRACTURE OF THE STEEL PIPE WAS CAUSED BY THE APPLICATION OF A SINGLE HIGH LOAD EXCEEDING THE FRACTURE STRENGTH OF THE STEEL. THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT ENVIRONMENT OR FATIGUE LOADING CONTRIBUTED TO THIS FAILURE.  UPON GAINING ACCESS TO THE MOBILE HOME ON 5/5/2014, WASHINGTON GAS CONDUCTED A PRESSURE TEST ON THE REMAINING HOUSE LINES UNDER THE OBSERVATION OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE MARSHAL.  THE HOUSE LINE TO THE STOVE WAS FRACTURED AND THE STOVE WAS FOUND ON THE GROUND BENEATH THE FLOOR LEVEL OF THE MOBILE HOME.  THIS LINE WAS CAPPED TO PERFORM THE PRESSURE TEST.  THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT 10 INCHES OF WATER COLUMN FOR 13 MINUTES.  THE HOUSE LINES HELD THE PRESSURE TEST.  THE FRACTURED LINE TO THE STOVE WAS REMOVED FOR ANALYSIS.

EIGHT FATALITIES AND APPROXIMATELY 48 REPORTED INJURIES RESULTED FROM THE EXPLOSION AND COLLAPSE.    CON EDISON'S RESPONSE AND ACTION:    AT 09:13 ON MARCH 12, 2014, CON EDISON'S GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER (GERC) RECEIVED A TELEPHONE REPORT FROM CON EDISON'S CALL CENTER OF AN INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GAS ODOR AT 1652 PARK AVENUE.  AT 09:15, GERC DISPATCHED A GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) MECHANIC TO INVESTIGATE THE ODOR REPORT.  AT 09:34, GERC CONFIRMED WITH NEW YORK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT (FDNY) A SCANNER REPORT OF AN EXPLOSION AND BUILDING COLLAPSE AT E. 114TH ST. AND PARK AVENUE (THE E. 114TH ST. LOCATION WAS INCORRECT).  AT 09:38, THE GDS MECHANIC ENROUTE TO 1652 PARK AVENUE REPORTED OBSERVING SMOKE, FLAMES, AND HEAVY ACTIVITY ON PARK AVENUE SOUTH OF E. 119TH STREET.  GERC DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL CON EDISON PERSONNEL TO THE LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 09:38.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL FIRST ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION AT 09:40 AND CONFIRMED THE EXPLOSION AND COLLAPSE OF TWO BUILDINGS ON PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E. 116TH ST. AND E. 117TH ST.    NUMEROUS CON EDISON PERSONNEL, INCLUDING GDS MECHANICS, CONSTRUCTION CREWS, SUPERVISORS, PLANNERS, AND MANAGERS RESPONDED TO THE SCENE OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSE.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION FOR GAS MIGRATION THAT INCLUDED ADJACENT BUILDINGS AND ACCESSIBLE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES IN THE AREA.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THREE (3) FIRE BANK LOCATIONS FOR EXCAVATION TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E 116TH ST AND E 117TH ST.  AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, A STREET COLLAPSE AND AN APPARENT WATER MAIN BREAK WERE OBSERVED IN THE ROADWAY IN FRONT OF 1644 AND 1646 PARK AVENUE.  AT THE TIME OF THE STREET COLLAPSE, THERE WAS A STRONG ODOR OF GAS IN THE AREA.    FIRE BANK EXCAVATIONS WERE COMPLETED AND STOPPERS WERE INSTALLED TO ISOLATE THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, AND THE ODOR OF GAS DISSIPATED.  THE 8"" LOW PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE / 8"" LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN SUPPLYING (7) SERVICES ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE AND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF E. 116TH ST., BETWEEN PARK AVENUE AND MADISON AVENUE, WERE ISOLATED.    INVESTIGATION:    FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) TOOK CONTROL OF THE INCIDENT SITE AND BEGAN ITS INVESTIGATION. THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, AND GEORG FISCHER CENTRAL PLASTIC WERE PARTIES TO THE INVESTIGATION. DURING THE COURSE OF THE NTSB INVESTIGATION, CON EDISON PROVIDED A PARTY SUBMISSION DESCRIBING THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AS A BREACH IN THE SEWER SYSTEM WHICH CAUSED SOIL EROSION AFFECTING SUBSURFACE UTILITIES, INCLUDING A CAST IRON WATER MAIN AND HDPE GAS FACILITIES, AND LIKELY RESULTED IN AN IMPACT BY FALLING ROADWAY PAVEMENT WHICH CRACKED THE SERVICE TEE TO 1642 PARK AVENUE. IN ITS ACCIDENT REPORT ADOPTED ON JUNE 9, 2015, THE NTSB DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS (1) THE FAILURE OF THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT AT THE SERVICE TEE, INSTALLED BY CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, INC., IN 2011, THAT ALLOWED NATURAL GAS TO LEAK FROM THE GAS MAIN AND MIGRATE INTO THE BUILDING WHERE IT IGNITED AND (2) A BREACH IN THE SEWER LINE THAT WENT UNREPAIRED BY THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SINCE AT LEAST 2006 THAT ALLOWED GROUNDWATER AND SOIL TO FLOW INTO THE SEWER, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF SUPPORT FOR THE GAS MAIN, WHICH CAUSED THE LINE TO SAG AND OVERSTRESSED THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT."

SW IN CARMEL.  A PACIFIC GAS & ELECTRIC (PG&E) CONSTRUCTION CREW TAPPED INTO A 2-INCH DIAMETER STEEL MAIN AND INADVERTENTLY TAPPED THROUGH THE 11/4-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC MAIN INSERTED IN THE 2-INCH STEEL MAIN.  THE CREW WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE 11/4-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC MAIN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN INSERTED INTO THE 2-INCH DIAMETER STEEL LINE.  THE CAUSAL EVALUATION OF THE INCIDENT PERFORMED BY A THIRD PARTY INVESTIGATOR DETERMINED THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION TO BE ""INADEQUATE VERIFICATION OF SYSTEM STATUS AND CONFIGURATION WHEN PERFORMING WORK ON A LIVE LINE.""  PG&E HAS DETERMINED THAT GAS MOST LIKELY ESCAPED FROM THE 11/4-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC MAIN AND MIGRATED INTO A SEPARATED SEWER LATERAL THAT PROVIDED A PATH INTO THE HOUSE.  NO ONE WAS IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  A PG&E GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WAS ON SITE AT 1135 HOURS.  PG&E REPAIR CREWS WERE ON SITE AT 1138 HOURS.  THE HOUSE WAS NOT OCCUPIED AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED THE HOMES IN A 1-BLOCK RADIUS.  DEBRIS FROM THE EXPLOSION FELL ONTO THE ROOF OF A NEIGHBORING HOUSE, AND GAS SERVICE TO THAT HOUSE WAS SHUT OFF AS A PRECAUTION.  THE FLOW OF GAS WAS STOPPED AT 1145 HOURS BY SQUEEZING THE MAIN AT TWO LOCATIONS.  THE REPAIR CREW ALSO DUG UP AND SQUEEZED THE SERVICE LINE TO THE DAMAGED HOUSE.  THE GAS MAIN WAS THEN CAPPED AT 1209 HOURS.  THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE DOT AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DUE TO PROPERTY DAMAGES EXCEEDING $50,000.  PG&E CONDUCTED A SPECIAL LEAK SURVEY AFTER THE INCIDENT, AND ONE LEAK ON A SERVICE VALVE IN THE VICINITY WAS FOUND AND REPAIRED.  SERVICE TO THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE WAS RESTORED ON 3/11/2014 BY THE HOMEOWNER'S CONTRACTOR WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO PG&E, HOWEVER, AFTER THE OCCUPANTS INFORMED PG&E ON 3/12/2014, PG&E PERFORMED A SERVICE SHUT DOWN AND RESTART ON 3/12/2014, INCLUDING A PRESSURE CHECK, A SOAP TEST, AND A SAFETY CHECK OF ALL THE GAS APPLIANCES IN THE HOME."

WARD	GAS REGULATORY SERVICES LEAD	517-545-8746	amanda.ward@cmsenergy	"CONSUMERS ENERGY'S FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SITE AT 2754 WILDER LANE IN WATERFORD, MI AT 10:49 PM, FEBRUARY 28, 2014, TO RESPOND TO A HOUSEFIRE INCIDENT.  PIN BAR TESTING WAS PERFORMED AT THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE METER, WHERE 15% GAS READS WERE FOUND.  ADDITIONAL BAR TESTING REVEALED SUSTAINED 95% GAS READS AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND 100% GAS READS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET WEST OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE ROAD.  A STRONG GAS ODOR WAS EVIDENT IN THIS LOCATION.  FIRST RESPONDERS THEN TOOK GAS READINGS INSIDE THE BASEMENT AFTER BEING ESCORTED IN BY THE FIRE MARSHALL.    BAR TESTING AT ADJACENT HOUSES (SOUTH AND WEST OF 2754 WILDER) PRODUCED NO GAS READS.    AT 1:42 AM ON MARCH 1, A GAS DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED AND EXPOSED THE 2 INCH STEEL MAIN IN FRONT OF (WEST OF) 2754 WILDER.  THE MAIN WAS BENT, CRACKED AND LEAKING.  THE CREW OPENED UP THE HOLE TO VENT THE BLOWING GAS.  A FROST BALL ON THE LEAK WAS KNOCKED OFF AT 5:45 AM, AT WHICH POINT THE GAS BEGAN BLOWING.  AT 9:20 AM, A 2"" PLIDCO REPAIR SLEEVE, WHICH STOPPED THE LEAK AND REPAIRED THE MAIN. INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS DAMAGE DURING INSTALLATION OF A WATER MAIN; THE EXACT TIME PERIOD OF THE WATER MAIN INSTALLATION IS UNKNOWN. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED ON THE OBSERVED DAMAGE AND PROXIMITY OF THE WATER MAIN. THE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE. A SEARCH OF MISS DIG STAKING REQUESTS FOR THIS LOCATION DID NOT YIELD ANY RECENT STAKING TICKETS WITHIN THE LAST 15 MONTHS.    THE ORIGIN OF THE HOUSEFIRE WAS APPARENTLY THE BASEMENT OF THE HOME.  ALTHOUGH AN ON-SCENE INVESTIGATOR REPRESENTING THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE COMPANY (STATE FARM) INDICATED THAT THE GAS LEAK MAY HAVE CAUSED THE FIRE, FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION BY CONSUMERS ENERGY INDICATES THAT THIS SCENARIO IS UNLIKELY.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF AN EXPLOSION OR INDEED IGNITION OF GAS IN THE HOME, AND WHILE THERE WERE EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS OF GAS DETECTED IN THE BASEMENT BY FIRST RESPONDERS (0.16% GAS READS, OR 4% LEL), THIS SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS (INCLUDING THOSE IN THE BASEMENT) BEING OPENED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, ALLOWING GAS TO ENTER THE HOME FROM OUTSIDE.  THERE WERE NO APPARENT CRACKS OR HOLES IN THE BASEMENT WALL WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE PROVIDE A PATH OF MIGRATION INTO THE HOME, AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND ON THE METER OR THE STEEL GAS SERVICE TO THE HOME.  FURTHERMORE, THE MAJORITY OF FIRE DAMAGE WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE BASEMENT (THE SIDE CLOSEST TO THE GAS FACILITIES)    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF ON SITE WAS ULTIMATELY UNABLE TO COME TO A DETERMINATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSEFIRE.  DUE TO THE LACK OF CERTAINTY ABOUT THE SOURCE OF FIRE, AS WELL AS PROPERTY DAMAGE WITHIN THE HOME (DAMAGES TO APPLIANCES AND SMOKE DAMAGE) LIKELY EXCEEDING $50,000, THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. DAMAGE ESTIMATES FROM THE FIRE OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS INVESTIGATORS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $50,000 TO $110,000; INSURANCE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES STATED THAT THE HOME WAS INSURED TO A VALUE OF $160,000.     INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WERE INCONCLUSIVE AND REPORTED AS SUCH ON THE 30-DAY PHMSA REPORT ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED ON MARCH 27, 2014.  SUBSEQUENT SPECULATION BY AN INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTIGATOR (WITHOUT PERFORMING ANY INVESTIGATION) WAS THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS NATURAL GAS MIGRATION FROM AN EXTERNAL NATURAL GAS LEAK (CAUSED BY THE INSTALLATION OF A WATER MAIN).  THE SPECULATION OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTIGATOR WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE WATERFORD REGIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT'S REPORT.  DUE TO THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THE SCENE BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, NO ACTUAL INVESTIGATION WAS POSSIBLE AND NO LEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE REACHED."

GAS CREWS RESPONDED AND CONFIRMED LEAKAGE AND THAT THE WATER HAD ENTERED THE GAS MAIN.  THE WATER CREWS ISOLATED THE WATER MAIN AT THE INCURSION POINT AND SOCALGAS EXCAVATED AND REPAIRED THE GAS LEAK WITH A CLAMP.  WHILE THE GAS LEAK WAS BEING BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL, SOCALGAS BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE AREA TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE WATER INCURSION.  NUMEROUS LOCATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED DUE TO LOW ELEVATION AND ENDS OF THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AS WATER EXTRACTION POINTS.  OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FIVE DAYS, APPROXIMATELY 6,100 GALLONS OF WATER WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE GAS LINES AND 1,751 IMPACTED METERS WERE REPLACED.

INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE WATER MAIN, LOCATED PERPENDICULAR TO AND DIRECTLY ABOVE THE GAS MAIN HAD A CORROSION LEAK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE.  THAT WATER LEAK, OVER TIME, BORED A HOLE INTO THE TOP OF THE GAS MAIN.  THE WATER PRESSURE WAS APPROXIMATELY 100 PSIG AND THE GAS WAS OPERATING AT 45 PSIG WHICH ALLOWED THE WATER TO ENTER THE GAS MAIN.

FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT FOUND THE LEAK TO HAVE OCCURRED ON A 1"" PE SERVICE STUB.  THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK ON THE 1"" PE LINE REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION BY SWG.    NOTE: FOR PART A, #10, THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF GAS RELEASED THAT IS IDENTIFIED REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE THAT PRESUMES A CRACK THAT IS LEAKING AT 57 PSI, BEGINNING AT THE TIME OF THE INTIAL REPORT OF THE INCIDENT AND ENDING AT THE TIME THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN.  HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF GAS LOSS IS UNKNOWN BECAUSE THE TIME THE GAS PIPELINE BEGAN LEAKING IS UNKNOWN.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:  LABORATORY ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE LEAKS WERE PRESENT DUE TO THERMAL OXIDATION OF THE PIPES AT 1914 AND 1924 E. PALOMINO.  THE THERMAL OXIDATION OF THE PIPES RESULTED IN AXIAL SLIT-CRACKS ON THE PIPES AT BOTH LOCATIONS.  SECTION G5 IS REVISED TO REFLECT THIS FACT."

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS AN 1/8 INCH HOLE IN THE PLASTIC GAS SERVICE LINE WHERE IT CROSSED THE PLASTIC WATER SERVICE LINE. PENDING THE OUTCOME OF LAB ANALYSIS, THE CONCLUSION OF CGV'S INVESTIGATION IS THAT DURING INSTALLATION OF THE GAS SERVICE ON JANUARY 2, 2014, THE UNLOCATED (UNLOCATABLE) PRIVATE WATER SERVICE LINE WAS STRUCK WHILE DIRECTIONAL DRILLING CAUSING DAMAGE. THE WATER METER WAS SET AT THE SITE ON JANUARY 23, 2014 AND SOMETIME AFTER, THE WATER WAS TURNED ON TO THE PROPERTY. WHEN THE WATER SERVICE WAS PRESSURIZED, THE WATER PRESSURE FROM THE HOLE IN THE WATER SERVICE LINE CAUSED A HOLE TO EVENTUALLY FORM IN THE PLASTIC GAS SERVICE LINE.

BANCROFT STREET.  AN FSD TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE THIS LEAK.  HE ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 17:29 AND BEGAN HIS INVESTIGATION.  A READING OF 70% LEL AT THE FRONT FOUNDATION WALL TO 1845 S. BANCROFT WAS REPORTED BY THE TECHNICIAN TO THE FSD DISPATCHER.  BASED ON THIS REPORT, A DISTRIBUTION CREW WAS DISPATCHED AT 18:10.  FSD AND DISTRIBUTION SUPERVISION WERE ALSO DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION.  THE CREW ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 18:24 AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR INVESTIGATION.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WHILE THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND THE FSD TECHNICIAN WERE INSIDE THE PROPERTY AT 1849 S. BANCROFT CHECKING FOR GAS READINGS, AN EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 19:05 INSIDE 1849 S. BANCROFT.  THE EXPLOSION SEVERELY DAMAGED THE TWO RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AT 1849 AND 1847 S. BANCROFT.  IT ALSO INJURED BOTH PGW EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE, AS WELL AS ONE HOMEOWNER.  THE INJURIES SUSTAINED BY ALL THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE NON-LIFE THREATENING.  BOTH THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND HOMEOWNER WERE TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT AND RELEASED ON THE SAME DAY WHILE THE FSD TECHNICIAN WAS ADMITTED WITH BURNS TO HIS NECK AND LOWER TORSO.  THE EXPLOSION AT THE SCENE WAS OBSERVED BY A FSD SUPERVISOR WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 19:05.  PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT, PHILADELPHIA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND PECO ENERGY WERE CALLED IN FOR ASSISTANCE, IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS PGW RESOURCES SUCH AS, DISTRIBUTION CREWS, FSD TECHNICIANS, MOBILE EQUIPMENT, GREASE TRUCK, SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL, CHEMICAL SERVICES, ETC.  THE PAPUC WAS ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.    THE GAS MAIN IN THE EAST FOOTWAY IN FRONT OF 1849 S. BANCROFT (4"" 1939 LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN) WAS GREASED OFF THROUGH A PLASTIC SERVICE TO 1843 S. BANCROFT AT 19:51 AND THE LEAK CONSEQUENTLY WAS MADE SAFE.  AS A RESULT OF THE GREASING OFF, A TOTAL OF FOUR (4) PROPERTIES WERE TEMPORARILY OUT OF GAS.  PECO ALSO SHUT OFF THE ELECTRIC POWER TO 1849 S. BANCROFT AT 21:00.  AFTER MAKING THE JOB SAFE AND RECEIVING THE GO AHEAD FROM PFD, PGW PERSONNEL ON THE SCENE CONTINUED WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  EVERY BUILDING ON THE 1800 BLOCK OF S. BANCROFT WAS CHECKED FOR GAS READINGS.  ALSO, THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN ON THE BLOCK ALONG WITH ALL ACTIVE GAS SERVICES WERE BAR HOLED IN ORDER TO CHECK FOR ANY POSSIBLE LEAKS.  DURING THIS BLOCK CHECK THE CREW PICKED UP LEL READINGS IN FRONT OF 1835 AND 1816/1818.  A BROKEN MAIN WAS EVENTUALLY FOUND AND REPAIRED IN FRONT OF 1818 AND A TOTAL OF SIX (6) SERVICES ON THE BLOCK WERE RENEWED WITH PLASTIC.  THE GREASED 4"" MAIN WAS ALSO CUT AND CAPPED AT 03:45.  THIS PORTION OF THE 4"" MAIN THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED (100') WAS AIR TESTED AT 6"" WC AND THE TEST FAILED.  THIS SECTION OF THE MAIN WAS THEN EXCAVATED COMPLETELY AND A BROKEN MAIN WAS FOUND IN FRONT OF 1849.  AN 8' SECTION OF THE PIPE, CONTAINING THE BROKEN MAIN, WAS CUT AND REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION, TAGGED AS EVIDENCE AND TRANSPORTED TO THE PGW EVIDENCE ROOM ON 1/31/2014.  IT IS BELIEVED FROST HEAVE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE BROKEN MAIN, FOURTEEN INCHES OF FROST WAS MEASURED AT THIS LOCATION. THE SERVICES TO 1845 AND 1847 (BOTH 1 1/4"" UNPROTECTED STEEL SERVICES) WERE ALSO AIR TESTED AND FAILED.  AFTER THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED, THE GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE SHUT OFF DURING THE GREASE OFF PROCESS.  THE BUILDING AT 1849 WAS DEMOLISHED ON 2/1/2014. PGW SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN.    ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT PIPE SHOWED THAT IT NEVER COMPLETELY FRACTURED CIRCUMFERENTIALLY AND THE CRACK WAS CONSIDERED TIGHT WITH NO LARGE GAP BETWEEN THE MATING SURFACES. THE CAST IRON MAIN EXHIBITED GRAPHITIZATION BUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPE WOULD HAVE PERSISTED IF LEFT UNDISTURBED AND NOT UNDER LOADING CONDITIONS. THE LOADING CONDITIONS ARE BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED BY THE EFFECTS OF 14 INCHES OF FROST."

THE CALLER STATED THE FIRE WAS CONTAINED AND THAT THERE WAS ALSO GAS BURNING. WE ENERGIES IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED A FIRST RESPONDER TO THE SITE.  THE FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SITE AT 11:47 A.M. AND OBSERVED A STRUCTURE FIRE; BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF AN EXPLOSION. THE EMPLOYEE NOTED THAT THE STRUCTURE FIRE WAS ESSENTIALLY UNDER CONTROL BUT NATURAL GAS WAS BURNING AT THE OUTSIDE METER AND AT A FEW LOCATIONS ON THE GROUND NEAR THE BUILDING. THE FIRST RESPONDER SAW THAT MORE RESOURCES WERE NEEDED TO REMOTELY SHUT OFF THE GAS AND MADE THE REQUEST TO THE DISPATCHER. THE FIRST RESPONDER AND ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WHO HAD ARRIVED PROCEEDED TO CHECK FOR GAS MIGRATION AND WORK WITH FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL TO KEEP A SAFE PERIMETER. INITIAL PROBING AND RECHECKS VERIFIED THAT GAS WAS ONLY IN THE AREA OF THE STRUCTURE FIRE.  AT ABOUT 12:52 P.M., MORE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND BEGAN DIGGING TO REMOTELY SQUEEZE OFF GAS ON THIS ONE-WAY FEED TO 2800 LAKESHORE WAY AND THE PROPERTY TO THE NORTH. A FROST DEPTH OF ABOUT 3 FT. MADE EXCAVATION HARD, AND THE 1958-INSTALLED 1 1/4 IN. STEEL GAS MAIN TO THE PROPERTIES WAS SQUEEZED OFF AT ABOUT 3:09 P.M. ALL FIRE AT THE PROPERTY WAS EXTINGUISHED SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  TO CONFIRM THE UNOCCUPIED HOME TO THE NORTH WAS SAFE, ACCESS WAS GAINED WITH POLICE ASSISTANCE AT ABOUT 1:30 P.M. AND ALL THREE LEVELS CHECKED AT 0%.  DUE TO THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE POTENTIALLY CAUSED BY GAS LEAKAGE FROM OPERATOR FACILITIES, A PHONE NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT ABOUT 4:00 P.M. TO REPORT THIS EVENT AS A POSSIBLE INCIDENT PER 49 CFR PART 191.3. THE WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (WPSC) WAS ALSO NOTIFIED.  A LINE STOPPER WAS INSTALLED AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY BY ABOUT 6:30 P.M. ON 1/30/14. AFTER VERIFYING THAT THE SITE WAS SAFE, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO WAIT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY TO CONDUCT FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.  ON 1/31/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE FOR INVESTIGATIONS. INITIAL PRESSURE TESTING OF THE ABANDONED MAIN AND SERVICE INDICATED AN UNDERGROUND LEAK, AND IT WAS BELIEVED NECESSARY TO EXCAVATE AT THE SERVICE TEE. SINCE THE PROPERTY OWNERS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ASSIST WITH MOVING NECESSARY PERSONAL PROPERTY, FURTHER EXCAVATION WAS DELAYED UNTIL FEBRUARY 4TH.  ON 2/4/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION. UPON EXCAVATION AT THE SERVICE TEE LOCATION FOR 2800 LAKESHORE WAY, A BENT SECTION OF MAIN WAS IDENTIFIED. THE MAIN WAS BENT IN AN ARC, AND WAS DISPLACED VERTICALLY BY ABOUT 3 IN. OVER A 6 FT. LENGTH. THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE WAS FLATTENED AND A CRACK WAS FOUND IN THE BENT SECTION OF THE PIPE. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE DAMAGE OCCURRED DURING A PRIOR EXCAVATION AND THAT MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE DEEP FROST LEVELS OBSERVED THIS WINTER CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE. ONE-CALL CENTER RECORDS DO NOT INDICATE ANY RECENT LOCATE TICKET REQUESTS AND IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE EXCAVATION ACTIVITY THAT DAMAGED THE PIPE OCCURRED MANY YEARS AGO.  A NEW PE MAIN WAS INSTALLED ON LAKESHORE WAY AND GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED PROPERTY WAS RESTORED ON 2/14/14.  A FORMAL INCIDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON 2/21/14. PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVIEW INCLUDED GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKERS AT THE SCENE AFTER THE FIRE WAS REPORTED AND OTHER COMPANY PERSONNEL WHO ASSISTED AT THE SCENE. PIPELINE SAFETY ENGINEERS FROM THE WPSC, ONE OF WHOM HAD INSPECTED THE SITE THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE, ALSO ATTENDED. THE REVIEW RECOUNTED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY EACH PARTICIPANT AND INCLUDED COMMUNICATIONS CONDUCTED AMONG INVOLVED PERSONNEL.  WE ENERGIES IS PERFORMING MORE LEAK SURVEYS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED IN CFR 49, PART 192 ON SIMILAR TYPE FACILITIES BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME WINTER CONDITIONS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITOR"

UPON ARRIVAL THE FD WAS MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE FIRE BURNING IN THE YARD NEAR THE SIDE WALK WHERE THE SERVICE WAS LOCATED AND HAD EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE TO THE HOUSE.  SOCALGAS EXCAVATED AND PINCHED THE SERVICE TO STOP THE GAS FLOW.  A SO CAL EDISON CREW WORKING NEAR THE RESIDENCE REPORTED THAT HIGH WINDS HAD CAUSED TWO POWER LINES TO COME IN CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.  THE EDISON CREW SAID THIS CAUSED THE NEARBY TRANSFORMER TO BLOW CAUSING 12,000 VOLTS TO GO TO GROUND.  THE CUSTOMER OF THE INVOLVED RESIDENCE REPORTED THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE (PRESUMABLY THE TRANSFORMER) AND THE LIGHTS INSIDE THE HOME FLASHED OFF AND ON BEFORE FINALLY REMAINING OFF.  A NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR KNOCKED ON THEIR DOOR AND ADVISED THAT THEIR HOUSE WAS ON FIRE AND TO GET OUT.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES.      AFTER EXCAVATING THE RESIDENCE'S SERVICE LINE, A 1/2"" DIAMETER HOLE WAS FOUND IN THE BOTTOM OF THE 3/4"" STEEL SERVICE LINE NEAR THE AREA WHERE THE FIRE HAD BEEN LOCATED.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS 1/4"" ABOVE A CAST IRON SEWER LINE AND THE ELECTRICITY LIKELY ARCED BETWEEN THESE TWO LINES CAUSING THE DAMAGE.  A CROSS-SECTION OF THE SERVICE LINE SHOWED THE STEEL WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.     SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN RESTORED TO THIS ADDRESS AS THE HOME OWNER IS MAKING REPAIRS FROM THE FIRE DAMAGE.  SERVICE WILL BE RESTORED ONCE REQUESTED.      IN ADDITION TO THIS LOCATION, THE SURROUNDING AREA WAS LEAK SURVEYED ON JAN 14TH, TO ENSURE NO ADDITIONAL DAMAGE HAD OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS ELECTRICAL INCIDENT.  A MINOR LEAK WAS DETECTED ON A 3/4"" STEEL SERVICE IN THE PARKWAY OF 407 ACACIA AVE IMMEDIATELY ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE DAMAGED TRANSFORMER.  HOWEVER, IT IS NOT RELATED TO THIS ELECTRICAL INCIDENT AND WAS REPAIRED BY MEANS OF A CLAMP JAN 15TH.

IN SHREWSBURY WHILE PERFORMING A MAIN CUT OUT. THE CREW WAS CUTTING OUT A SECTION OF 4 INCH IP PLASTIC MAIN THAT WAS LEAKING. THE CREW HAD INSTALLED A 2 INCH PLASTIC BYPASS AROUND THE LEAK AND HAD SQUEEZED OFF THE 4 INCH MAIN TO STOP OFF THE GAS. WHILE PREPARING FOR THE MAIN CUT OUT OF 4 INCH PLASTIC, A SUDDEN RUSH OF GAS OCCURRED AND THEN THE GAS IGNITED CAUSING A FIRE TO OCCUR IN THE EXCAVATION. THERE WERE 2 EMPLOYEES IN THE EXCAVATION WHO WERE ABLE TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF THE HOLE JUST BEFORE THE IGNITION OCCURRED. ONE OF THESE EMPLOYEES DID RECEIVE SOME BURNS AND WAS TREATED AND RELEASED FROM A HOSPITAL. THE RESULTING FIRE ALSO SPREAD TO AN NSTAR BACKHOE PARKED AT THE EXCAVATION. THE SHREWSBURY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO CONTROL THE GAS FIRE. AT 1:50 PM A MAIN VALVE ON COLONIAL DR. WAS SHUT TO STOP THE LEAKING GAS AND PUT OUT THE FIRE. THIS RESULTED IN AN OUTAGE TO 135 CUSTOMERS. NSTAR HAD TO REPLACE ABOUT 20 FEET OF 4 INCH PLASTIC MAIN DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE. AFTER THE SHUTDOWN PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED FOR ALL CUSTOMERS, THE GAS MAINS WERE PURGED AND THE GAS WAS TURNED BACK ON AT 8:15 PM. THE FIRST CUSTOMER WAS RE-LIT AT 8:30 PM AND A FIRST PASS TO RE-LITE ALL 135 CUSTOMERS WAS COMPLETED AT 11:45 PM. NSTAR IS IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING WAS CAUSED THE SUDDEN LEAKAGE OF GAS AND ALSO WHAT CAUSED THE IGNITION TO OCCUR.    SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE - UPON INVESTIGATION, IT WAS FOUND THAT A COMPLETE SQUEEZE WAS NOT ACHIEVED WITH A MUSTANG SQUEEZE TOOL USED ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE REPAIR. THIS RESULTED IN LIVE GAS IN WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE AN ISOLATED SECTION OF MAIN. THIS WAS NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE CREW, WHO THEN BEGAN TO REMOVE A STEEL FULL ENCIRCLEMENT CLAMP THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED 3 DAYS PRIOR AS A TEMPORARY REPAIR, WHICH LED TO A RELEASE OF GAS. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT STATIC ELECTRICITY IGNITED THIS GAS. OM PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED FOR THE REPAIR AND HAVE SINCE BEEN REVISED TO INCLUDE ADDED SAFETY MEASURES."

AT AROUND 8:30 AM, A CASS LAKE SCHOOL SYSTEM EMPLOYEE NOTED GAS LEAKING FROM THE SERVICE RELIEF VALVE AT THE CASS LAKE HIGH SCHOOL.  HE REPORTED THIS TO HIS SUPERVISOR, PETE RAIRDON (AT HOME AT THE TIME).  MR. TOLD HIS EMPLOYEE THAT HE ( MR. RAIRDON) WAS ON HIS WAY TO HELP AND ALSO INSTRUCTED HIS EMPLOYEE TO CALL THE CASS LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT IN CASE THE PROBLEM WAS MORE THAN THE TWO OF THEM COULD HANDLE.    AT 9:12 AM JACK PALKKI (NW GAS ON-CALL TECHNICIAN) RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CASS COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DISPATCHER THAT THE CASS LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON-SITE AT THE CASS LAKE HIGH SCHOOL AND THAT THERE WAS AN OUTDOOR GAS LEAK REPORTED.  JACK ASKED FOR AN ON-SITE CONTACT NUMBER WHICH HE WAS GIVEN AND WHEN HE MADE CONTACT WITH THE ON-SITE PERSONNEL LEARNED THAT THE GAS WAS NOW OFF AND THE SITUATION AT THE SCHOOL WAS SAFE.    JACK THEN CALLED JOE ROY (NW GAS AREA SUPERVISOR) TO CONFER ABOUT WHAT WOULD LIKELY BE NEEDED TO RETURN THE SCHOOL SERVICE TO OPERATION.  AT THIS POINT THE SUSPICION WAS A FAILED SERVICE REGULATOR AND THE DISCUSSION REFLECTED THAT.    A SECOND CALL FROM THE SHERIFF'S DISPATCHER REPORTING GAS LEAKING FROM THE SERVICE RELIEF VALVE AT THE CASINO PROMPTED JACK AND JOE TO SUSPECT A LARGER PROBLEM AND TO GET JACK GOING IMMEDIATELY TO CASS LAKE.  THE GAS WAS REPORTED SHUT OFF AT THE CASINO WHICH TERMINATED THE LEAK THERE AS WELL.    AT THIS POINT, JOE RECEIVED A CALL FROM GARY LINDSTROM, THE CASS LAKE AREA GREAT LAKES GAS TRANSMISSION COMPANY FIELD TECHNICIAN, THAT A NEIGHBOR TO THE TBS LOCATION HAD REPORTED A HISSING SOUND AND THAT MR. LINDSTROM WAS ENROUTE (1/2 HOUR TRAVEL).  JOE GAVE MR. LINDSTROM JACK'S CELL NUMBER SO THAT THE TWO FIELD TECHS COULD COMMUNICATE.    JACK RECEIVED A CALL AT 11:07 FROM MR. LINDSTROM, WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED AT THE CASS LAKE TBS SITE, REPORTING THAT THERE WAS INDEED GAS ESCAPING FROM OUR SYSTEM'S TATTLE-TALE RELIEF VALVE AND THAT THE ESCAPING GAS HAD IGNITED.  JACK INSTRUCTED MR. LINDSTROM TO CALL THE CASS LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT, WHICH MR. LINDSTROM DID.  AT THIS POINT, JACK WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE SITE AND ARRIVED BEFORE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ALSO REPORTED THAT THEY HAD TURNED OFF A THIRD SERVICE (AT MAUREEN MOOSE'S RESIDENCE) DUE TO GAS LEAKAGE FROM THE REGULATOR RELIEF OPENING.    ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO ACCESSIBLE PRESSURE GAUGES PRESENT WHICH COULD BE USED TO VERIFY THE DISTRIBUTION PIPELINE PRESSURE, JACK DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE IN OUR PIPELINE, SO HE TURNED OFF A GREAT LAKES VALVE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.  AT THIS POINT JOE ROY CALLED MIKE GORHAM, OWNER OF THE SYSTEM TO ADVISE HIM OF THE EVENTS GOING ON AND THAT JOE WAS ENROUTE TO CASS LAKE.  JOE ALSO CALLED STEVE MCNIFF (ANOTHER NW GAS FIELD TECH) TO GET HIM MOVING TO CASS LAKE.  MIKE PROCEEDED TO ACT AS THE INCIDENT RESPONSE LEADER COORDINATING THE RESPONSE FROM THAT POINT.    WITH THE GAS TURNED OFF AT THE GREAT LAKES END AND THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE FALLING, MIKE ASKED JACK TO ARRANGE FOR A FIREMAN IN TURNOUT GEAR TO APPROACH THE STILL-DISCHARGING RELIEF VALVE AND TURN IT OFF IF THAT OPERATION COULD BE SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED IN TURNOUT GEAR.  THE FIREMAN AGREED AND THE GAS WAS SHUT OFF, WHICH EXTINGUISHED ALMOST ALL OF THE FIRE, THE ONLY REMNANT BEING GAS ESCAPING FROM THE SECOND-STAGE REGULATOR PILOT ON THE WEST REGULATOR RUN, WHICH WAS THEN ISOLATED USING THE INSTALLED ISOLATION VALVES.  THIS ELIMINATION OF THE FIRE HAZARD ALLOWED FOR THE INSERTION OF A PRESSURE GAUGE IN THE DISTRIBUTION PIPELINE.  THE INITIAL READING OF THIS GAUGE WAS JUST UNDER 110 PSIG.    AT THIS POINT, MIKE DIRECTED JOE TO STOP FIRST AT THE REPORTED GAS-OFF SITES TO RESTORE SERVICE.  SERVICE WAS SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED.    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS RELEASED FROM ALL OF THE RESPONSE SITES.  THE NW GAS RESPONSE NOW TURNED TO PRESE"

A CODE MURRE (MULTIPLE RESOURCE RESPONSE EVENT) WAS INITIATED AND GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS), NUMEROUS SUPERVISORS, CONSTRUCTION, PHOTOGRAPHER, CHEM LAB, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND ELECTRIC #9 WERE DISPATCHED. AT 08:16 A CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR ARRIVED ON LOCATION, AND CONFIRMED THE COLLAPSE WITH SIGNIFICANT FDNY, NYPD, & EMS RESPONSE. THE FDNY WAS IN THE COLLAPSED BUILDING ATTEMPTING TO SECURE AN OPEN-ENDED GAS PIPE. GERC SUPPLIED THE CURB VALVE LOCATION FOR 1300 BLONDELL AVE, AS 2601 WESTCHESTER AVE HAD NO DIRECT GAS SERVICE. THE GAS SUPPLY PIPE TO A CEILING MOUNTED SPACE HEATER HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY FALLING DEBRIS RESULTING IN GAS FREELY BLOWING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AT 08:22 THE FDNY TEMPORARILY SECURED THE OPEN-ENDED HOUSE PIPE WITH TAPE. AT 08:24 THE CURB VALVE WAS CLOSED SECURING THE LEAK. AT 08:27 GDS VERIFIED A 100% SHUTDOWN FROM THE 1.25"" LOW PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE CURB VALVE. AT 08:46 THE ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS DE-ENERGIZED TO THE BUILDING. CHANNEL 12 NEWS REPORTED THAT A ONE STORY AUTO BODY SHOP COLLAPSED DUE TO AN AIR COMPRESSOR EXPLOSION INSIDE THE BUILDING; ADDITIONAL REPORTS ON-SITE AND IN THE MEDIA STATED A GARAGE COMPRESSOR EXPLODED CAUSING THE BUILDING TO COLLAPSE. NO FIRE CONDITION WAS DETECTED PER FDNY CHIEF SAKOVICH. TWO OCCUPANTS, A FATHER AND SON (BENEDETTO MONDELLO - DOB-7/16/1950, BENJAMIN MONDELLO - DOB- 3/8/1978) WERE TAKEN BY EMS TO JACOBI HOSPITAL DUE TO INJURIES SUSTAINED IN THE EXPLOSION. FDNY CHIEF SEELIG INITIALLY REPORTED THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION.   INITIAL LEAK INVESTIGATIONS DETECTED NO GAS ODOR OR READINGS IN THE BUILDINGS ACCESSED AS WELL AS IN SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES. A POGO SURVEY OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA BY GDS DETECTED NO OUTSIDE READINGS. LEAK SURVEY RESPONDED AND PERFORMED SEVERAL LEAK SURVEYS OF THE AREA SURROUNDING THE INCIDENT. THE INITIAL SURVEY AT 09:10 DETECTED NO READINGS BUT A SECOND SURVEY AT 09:50 DETECTED 4.4% AT THE OUTSIDE FOUNDATION WALL OF 1314 COOPER AVE. THE FDNY PROVIDED ACCESS AND 2% WAS DETECTED IN THE ELECTRIC POINT OF ENTRY AT THE INSIDE FOUNDATION WALL. 1320 COOPER AVE WAS CHECKED AND FOUND CLEAR, AND SB 24280 SUPPLYING #1314 WAS CHECKED AND 60% READING WAS RECEIVED. THE COVER WAS PULLED TO VENT THE STRUCTURE. SB 22786 WAS CHECKED AND 58% WAS DETECTED AND THE COVER PULLED TO VENT THE STRUCTURE; ADJACENT MANHOLES M10930 AND M23142 WERE FOUND CLEAR. A BAR HOLE SURVEY DETECTED 40%-90% GAS READINGS OVER THE 6"" LPCI 1952 MAIN ON COOPER AVE. THE 6"" MAIN WAS EXCAVATED AND CUT ON THE 6"" SIDE OF THE 12"" X 12"" X 6"" 3-WAY TEE ON WESTCHESTER AND COOPER AVES. AN INTEGRITY TEST OF THE HOUSE PIPING FROM THE 1/2"" OPEN-ENDED PIPE BACK TO THE HOS VALVE WAS PERFORMED AT 6"" W.C AND PASSED AFTER A 10 MINUTE TEST WHICH WAS WITNESSED BY THE PSC. LEAK SURVEILLANCE OF THE AREA DETECTED NO GAS READINGS AFTER THE MAIN WAS CUT AND CAPPED. ON MONDAY, DEC. 2 A CAMERA INSPECTION WITNESSED BY THE PSC OF THE ISOLATED SECTION OF MAIN IDENTIFIED A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK WHICH WAS EXCAVATED, CONFIRMED AND REMOVED FOR ANALYSIS. CHEMICAL SAMPLING OF THE SOIL WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSE IDENTIFIED CHEMICALS INCLUDING ACETONE AND FUELS AT LEVELS THAT MET OR EXCEEDED NYC DEP AND/OR NYS DEC REPORTING THRESHOLDS AND NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THOSE AGENCIES. CHANNEL 2, 4 AND 12 NEWS MEDIA WERE ON LOCATION. CIG, PSC, DOT AND DEP WERE NOTIFIED. THERE WAS GREATER THAN $50,000 IN DAMAGE AND THE TWO INJURED OCCUPANTS REPORTEDLY SUSTAINED NON-LIFE THREATENING INJURIES.  THE PSC AND OSHA RESPONDED TO THE LOCATION.  THE FDNY FIRE MARSHALS ISSUED A REPORT CONCLUDING THAT THE INCIDENT WAS ATTRIBUTED TO NATURAL GAS."

THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE FAILURE OF HOPE GAS REGULATORS DUE TO ICING CONDITIONS.  THESE REGULATORS ARE LOCATED IN STATION HX-363 AND REDUCE PRESSURE FROM OVER 500 PSIG TO 70 PSIG.    AT 06:47, A SERVICE PIPELINE THAT IS CONNECTED TO M-3095 RUPTURED, CAUSING A BLOWING LEAK.  THE SYSTEM WAS ISOLATED AND COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AT 8:10.  NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OCCURRED.    A CONSULTANT (JANA LABORATORIES, INC.) WAS EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE INCIDENT AND RECOMMEND CHANGES.  AS ADVISED BY JANA LABS' PRELIMINARY REPORT, DOMINION HOPE GAS IS IN THE PROCESS OF INSPECTING AND/OR REPLACING VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SYSTEM.  TESTING OF THE PIPELINES AND THE REGULATING/METERING STATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 46 CFR PART 192.  THE SYSTEM WILL BE PLACED INTO SERVICE ONLY WHEN ALL COMPONENTS ARE DEEMED SAFE AND OPERATIONAL.    AS REQUESTED BY DOMINION, JANA LABORATORIES IS COMPILING AN ADDITIONAL REPORT TO RECOMMEND LONG-RANGE PLANS AND CONCERNS.    COMPLETION INFORMATION:    A CONSULTANT (JANA LABORATORIES) COMPLETED AN EVALUATION OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SYSTEM:    5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS  BASED ON THE ANALYSIS TO DATE AND THE TESTING OF THE SAMPLES RECEIVED, THE FOLLOWING  RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE:  &#61623; THE OVERPRESSURIZATION RESULTED IN THE EXPOSURE OF THREE REGULATOR STATIONS, THE HDPE  MAINLINE, AND THE MDPE BRANCH TO INCREASING PRESSURE UP TO >500 PSIG (MAXIMUM 528 PSIA,  OR 513 PSIG), RAMPING UP OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR. THE ROOT CAUSE WAS  REPORTEDLY THE FAILURE OF REGULATOR STATION HX-363 TO REGULATE PRESSURE FROM THE TRANSMISSION  LINE DUE TO FROZEN WATER IN THE REGULATOR RUN.  &#61623; THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPES AND FITTINGS HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS FOLLOWS:  O 6"" HDPE PIPE AND ASSOCIATED HEAT FUSION, ELECTROFUSION, AND TRANSITION FITTINGS: NO  EXPECTED IMPACT OF OVERPRESSURIZATION ON LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE  O 6"" HDPE BALL VALVES: NO EXPECTED IMPACT OF OVERPRESSURIZATION ON LONG-TERM  PERFORMANCE  O 4"" MDPE PIPE AND ASSOCIATED HEAT FUSION, ELECTROFUSION, AND TRANSITION FITTINGS  AFFECTED (PIPE BURST); NON-BURST REGIONS EXPOSED TO PRESSURE CLOSE TO TENSILE LIMIT  O 4"" MDPE BALL VALVE: POSSIBLY AFFECTED; EXPOSED TO PRESSURE CLOSE TO TENSILE LIMIT  &#61623; THE INTEGRITY OF THE REGULATOR STATIONS HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS FOLLOWS:  O HX-363: NOT EXPECTED TO BE AFFECTED; ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF ENTRAINED WATER FREEZING  ADVISED BEFORE REPRESSURIZATION  O TYGART VALLEY REGIONAL JAIL: POSSIBLY AFFECTED; METER, VALVES, AND REGULATORS EXPOSED TO  PRESSURE > MAOP  O IS-267: POSSIBLY AFFECTED; METER, VALVES AND REGULATORS EXPOSED TO PRESSURE > MAOP  &#61623; ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED COMPONENTS SHOULD BE CLOSELY EXAMINED FOR DAMAGE (IN SIMILAR  FASHION TO HX-363 AFTER THE INCIDENT) AND REPLACED IF DAMAGE IS FOUND. IT HAS BEEN INDICATED  THAT THE JAIL REGULATOR STATION AND THE ENTIRE MDPE LINE ARE SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED..    1 . REGULATORS WERE COMPLETED DISASSEMBLED AND INSPECTED AT ALL THREE STATIONS BY A CONSULTANT (MASTER CONTROLS).       REGULATORS WERE FOUND TO BE UNAFFECTED BY THE OVERPRESSURE SITUATION.  2   TWIN 3X4 MERCER RELIEF VALVES WERE INSTALLED AS ADDITIONAL OVER-PRESSURE PROTECTION AT THE HIGH PRESSURE CUT REGULATION STATION.  3.  BRUEST PILOT HEATERS WERE INSTALLED ON THE HIGH PRESSURE CUT REGULATION STATION.  4.  NEW STEEL ENAMEL BUILDING INSTALLED OVER THE HIGH PRESSURE CUT REGULATION STATION TO PROTECT HEATERS FROM THE WIND.  5.  MDPE PIPE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACE WITH HDPE.  6.  ENTIRE SYSTEM WAS RETESTED WITH AIR TO 155 LBS.  7.  COMPLETE STATION INSPECTIONS WERE PERFORMED WHEN GAS WAS REINTRODUCED.     GAS WAS REINTRODUCED ON 11/25/13."

PRIOR TO COMMENCING THE DRILLING WORK, THE CONTRACTOR CALLED THE HAWAII ONE CALL CENTER TO REQUEST THAT TONING BE DONE BY HG TO MARK THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE GAS LINE.  PER THE CONTRACTOR'S ONE CALL REQUEST, HG RESPONDED AND MARKED THE LOCATION OF ITS FACILITY.  USING THE TONING MARKS BY HG AND ITS OWN EQUIPMENT, CONTRACTOR ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM THE LOCATION OF THE GAS MAIN BEFORE DRILLING.  HG WAS ADVISED THAT THE CONTRACTOR ATTEMPTED TO AVOID DAMAGING OUR LINE BY DRILLING MORE THAN 30 INCHES HORIZONTALLY FROM THE PIPE LOCATION TONING MARK AND TEST BORING USING A NON-POWERED AUGER BEFORE USE OF THE POWERED DRILL RIG.    THE GAS MAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET DEEP WHEN THE CONTRACTOR'S POWERED DRILLING RIG HIT IT.  HG DISPATCHED A CREW TO BEGIN EXCAVATING TO INSTALL LINE STOP FITTINGS.  DUE TO THE PIPE'S DEPTH, HG HAD DIFFICULTY LOCATING AND EXPOSING THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE LINE WHERE THE REPAIR WORK WOULD NEED TO BE DONE AND HALTED WORK AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF EXCAVATING.  TWO PERSONNEL REMAINED ON SITE OVERNIGHT TO MONITOR THE LEAK.    ON 9/24/13, A NEW LOCATION WITH IMPROVED ACCESS TO THE GAS MAIN WAS SELECTED.  AT 10:00 AM, THE FEDERAL FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED SEVERAL BUILDINGS IN THE NEARBY NAVAL HOUSING AREA AS A PRECAUTION DUE TO THE DETECTION OF GAS.  HG LEAK INSPECTORS PERFORMED BELOW GRADE STRUCTURE CHECKS AND DETECTED 100% GAS READINGS IN SEVERAL MANHOLES.  AS A RESULT, HG SET UP BLOWERS TO VENTILATE THE MANHOLES TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ITS CREW AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.    BASED ON OUR INVESTIGATION, HG BELIEVES THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE CONTRACTOR'S INABILITY TO ACCURATELY LOCATE THE PIPE PRIOR TO COMMENCING DRILLING."

AS PART OF THE INCIDENT RESPONSE, A GAS SERVICE WORKER CHECKED THE HOME ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE FAILURE POINT, AND PERFORMED ADDITIONAL BAR TESTS WITHIN THE SOIL NEAR THE FAILURE.  NONE OF THESE TESTS FOUND ANY GAS MIGRATION.  ALL THE GAS WAS VENTING TO ATMOSPHERE DIRECTLY ABOVE THE POINT OF FAILURE.    THE POINT OF FAILURE ON THE MAIN WAS UNDER A COUNTY DRAIN DITCH, APPROXIMATELY 20' BELOW THE ROAD GRADE AND UNDER 14' OF SOIL.  THE MAIN WAS CAPPED ON EACH SIDE OF THE FAILURE UPON SHUTOFF.    THE FAILURE POINT WAS LATER EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED, REVEALING A FAILED BUTT FUSE JOINT.  INADEQUATE FUSE BEAD ROLLOVER WAS OBSERVED ON ONE SIDE OF THE FUSE, INDICATING POSSIBLE INCOMPLETE FACING PRIOR TO UTILIZING THE HYDRAULIC BUTT FUSE MACHINE.  THE NON-FUSED ZONE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A GENERALLY SMOOTH FLAT SURFACE APPEARANCE, AS WELL AS PARALLEL CUT MARKS WHICH LIKELY INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE HAD NOT BEEN HEATED TO THE MELTING POINT DURING THE JOINT FUSION OPERATION.    INITIAL ESTIMATES INDICATED THAT MORE THAN 3 MMCF OF GAS MAY HAVE BEEN RELEASED DURING THE LEAK, BUT REVISED FINDINGS (BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF THE FAILED FUSE; SEE ATTACHED), INDICATE A GAS RELEASE OF LESS THAN 1 MMCF.  A SUPPLEMENTAL PHMSA INCIDENT REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED HEREWITH TO REFLECT THIS, AND ALSO REFLECT THE COSTS INCURRED DURING REPLACEMENT AND INVESTIGATION OF THE FAILED MAIN."

UPON INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A MAINTENANCE WORKER CONTRACTED BY NYACK COLLEGE WAS PERFORMING SOME GRADING OF THE PROPERTY BEHIND 154 SOUTH HIGHLAND, THE BOWMAAN GYM THE MORNING OF THE EXPLOSION.  THIS WORKER, USING A BACKHOE, PULLED ON THE 2"" STEEL GAS SERVICE FOR THE BOWMAN GYM CAUSING IT TO PULL FROM A CONNECTING COUPLING CAUSING GAS TO LEAK.  THE GAS THEN MIGRATED THROUGH A STORM DRAIN INTO THE SEWER SYSTEM THAT WAS CONNECTED TO THE SKY ISLAND LODGE.  AN UNCAPPED, OPEN SEWER TRAP WAS DISCOVERED IN THE BASEMENT OF THE SKY ISLAND LODGE.  THIS WAS DEEMED THE POINT OF ENTRY INTO THE BUILDING FOR THE GAS.  THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED SHORTLY THEREAFTER."

COLUMBIA GAS OF OHIO'S THIRD PARTY CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THERE WERE TWO POTENTIAL SOURCES OF IGNITION IN THE EXCAVATION AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; A PNEUMATIC SCALER AND AN ELECTRIC WATER PUMP.  THE DAMAGE TO THE ELECTRIC WATER PUMP'S WIRING AND PROTECTIVE BOOT ALLOWED ARCING WHICH IS LIKELY THE IGNITION SOURCE OF THIS INCIDENT.  THERE IS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS THE CONDITION OF THE PROTECTIVE BOOT WAS COMPROMISED PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE COLUMBIA GAS OF OHIO INC. HAS PROHIBITED THE USE OF THESE WATER PUMPS BY ALL REPAIR CREWS AND IS ACTIVELY SEEKING A REPLACEMENT WATER PUMP WHICH IS NOT ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN.

GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (GDS), GAS CONSTRUCTION AND SUPERVISION WERE NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED. GAS CONSTRUCTION CONDUCTED A LEAK INVESTIGATION SURVEY OVER THE ROUTE OF THE 1948 12"" STEEL TRANSMISSION MAIN (245 PSI SYSTEM) AND THE 16"" MEDIUM PRESSURE CAST IRON (MPCI) MAIN IN THE AREA. ALL SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES IN THE AREA WERE CHECKED AND FOUND CLEAR; THERE WERE NO BUILDINGS IN THE AREA. GAS CONTROL WAS NOTIFIED AND CONTINGENCY CASE 39-A WAS INITIATED. ISOLATION VALVES 25977 AND 25976 WERE STAFFED AND GAS CONTROL CONFIRMED COMMUNICATION WITH REMOTE OPERATED VALVE (ROV) 32717. GAS CREWS CONTINUED TO AERATE, PINPOINT AND MONITOR THE AREA. ON THURSDAY, MARCH 21, 2013 AT 08:41 THE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED A PROBABLE TRANSMISSION MAIN LEAK APPROXIMATELY 175' SOUTH OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL GAS PIPELINE (TGPL) WHITE PLAINS GATE STATION LOCATED AT BRONX STREET AND MOTT STREET (WP).TRANSMISSION ENGINEERING, DISTRIBUTION ENGINEERING, GAS CONTROL, MAJOR PROJECTS, TECHNICAL OPERATIONS, GERC AND WESTCHESTER GAS OPERATIONS PARTICIPATED IN OPERATIONAL PLANNING TO IDENTIFY THE ACTIONS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SUPPLY TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE ACTIONS REQUIRED TO REPAIR THE SUSPECTED 12"" COUPLING BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK. REPAIR PROCEDURE MPC-13-09 WAS INITIATED AND ON FRIDAY, MARCH 22, 2013 AT 10:16 THE SEGMENT OF TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS ISOLATED AND PRESSURE REDUCED FROM 214 PSI TO 62 PSI. REPAIR OPERATIONS CONTINUED AROUND-THE-CLOCK AND A VISIBLE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED ON A 12"" COMPRESSION COUPLING. A WELDED REPAIR SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED TO SECURE THE LEAK. A SECOND WELDED REPAIR SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED ON A COUPLING NOT LEAKING BUT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY AS A PRECAUTION. ON SATURDAY, MARCH 23, 2013 A PRELIMINARY MOBILE LEAK SURVEY WAS PERFORMED IN ADVANCE OF PRESSURE RESTORATION AND (2) LEAKS WERE FOUND ALONG THE ROUTE OF THE TRANSMISSION MAIN. THE LEAKS WERE INVESTIGATED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THE TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS NOT THE SOURCE OF THE READINGS DETECTED. A THIRD T-1 WAS DETECTED DURING PRESSURE RESTORATION AND A 16"" MPCI HUB WAS FOUND TO BE THE SOURCE OF THAT LEAK.  ON MONDAY, MARCH 25, 2013 AT 02:00 THE ISOLATED SEGMENT WAS RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE. GAS CONTROL AND PRESSURE CONTROL ARE RETURNING THE REGULATOR STATIONS INVOLVED IN THIS PROCEDURE TO NORMAL SETTINGS. THERE WERE NO OUTAGES AS A RESULT OF THIS OPERATIONAL PLAN. NO EVACUATIONS, INJURIES OR MEDIA ATTENTION WERE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. THE WHITE PLAINS FIRE DEPARTMENT (WPFD) WAS NOTIFIED AND THE WPFD RESPONDED PER THE TRANSMISSION LEAK NOTIFICATION PROTOCOL AND REPAIR OPERATIONS WERE REVIEWED. THE US DOT AND NYS PSC WERE NOTIFIED AND THE PSC RESPONDED TO LOCATION. THIS WAS A SERIOUS LEVEL INCIDENT."

THE GAS OPERATOR BLACK HILLS ENERGY (BHE) WAS CONTACTED REGARDING FIRE AT 1853 HOURS.  STATE FIRE MARSHAL INVESTIGATOR DETERMINED THE PRODUCT TO BE NATURAL GAS AT 1915 HOURS  THE GAS OPERATOR WAS INFORMED OF PROBABLE INVOLVEMENT OF NATURAL GAS AT 1936 AND TO STOP THE FLOW OF NATURAL GAS TO AREA.  FIRST BHE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT LOCATION 1946 HOURS   ADDITIONAL BHE PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO LOCATION AND EXCAVATED THE SERVICE LINE, EXPOSING THE SERVICE LINE, CUT AND CAPPED THE SERVICE LINE.  GAS FLOW STOPPED AT 2245 HOURS.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT NATURAL GAS FROM A FAILED UNDERGROUND PIPE HAD VENTED ITSELF INSIDE THE STRUCTURE.  NATURAL GAS LEVELS INSIDE THE STRUCTURE INCREASED TO AN IGNITABLE LEVEL, IGNITION WAS PROVIDED BY A GAS FIRED OVERHEAD UNIT HEATER WITH STANDARD SAFETY PILOT.  THE NATURAL GAS FLASHED ACROSS THE ROOM AND BACK TO THE CRACKS IN THE FLOOR WHERE IT CONTINUED TO BURN, IGNITING COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS BELOW WORK BENCHES ALONG THE EAST AND WEST WALLS.  ON 3/5/13 GAS DEPARTMENT CREW EXCAVATED AN AREA NEAR A TEE JUNCTION IN THE SERVICE LINE REVEALING A MECHANICAL FITTING.    VISUALLY APPARENT WAS THE FACT THAT A SEGMENT OF  3/4' DUPONT ALDYL-A PE PIPING HAD PULLED OUT OF THE MECHANICAL FITTING APPROXIMATELY 3/4', ALLOWING GAS TO FLOW UNRESTRICTED UNDERGROUND.  THE MECHANICAL FITTING WAS REMOVED AND REMAINING PIPE SEGMENTS AIR TESTED AND DETERMINED TO BE LEAK FREE.  NATURAL GAS UNDERGROUND PIPING WITHIN THE COMPLEX WAS REPLACED."

CONSUMERS ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND FIELD PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SITE AT VARIOUS TIMES BETWEEN 1715 AND 1809 IN RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT.  WORKING WITH LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS, CONSUMERS ENERGY EXCAVATED AND SHUT OFF THE GAS SUPPLY TO 4232 COOPER AVE AT 1836 HOURS.    INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE INCIDENT REVIEW AND INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE CREWS DID NOT FOLLOW COMPANY BORING PROCEDURES DURING INSTALLATION OF A NEW MAIN ALONG COOPER AVENUE.  AS A RESULT, THE OPERATION CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE STEEL GAS SERVICE LOCATED AT 4232 COOPER AVENUE IN ROYAL OAK, MICHIGAN, RESULTING IN POSSIBLE BELOW-GRADE GAS MIGRATION INTO THE STRUCTURE.  INVESTIGATION ESTABLISHED THAT CREWS DID NOT FOLLOW CONSUMERS ENERGY PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS TO EXCAVATE AND EXPOSE ALL ACTIVE SERVICES PRIOR TO PERFORMING BORING OPERATIONS.  THESE CREWS ALSO FAILED TO FOLLOW COMPANY GAS LEAK RESPONSE STANDARDS.    NOTE (5/15/2013 SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT):  DESPITE THE NEARBY FACILITIES BEING STAKED CORRECTLY (PART G3-12) AND LOCATE MARKS BEING VISIBLE WITHIN THE VICINITY OF THE BORING AREA (PART G3-11), FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT THERE WAS MINIMAL OBSERVATION OF STAKING FLAGS OR PAINT MARKING AT SOME SERVICE LOCATIONS ALONG COOPER AVENUE.  THAT MARKING WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT DURING POST-INCIDENT OBSERVATIONS MAY BE DUE IN PART TO LARGE AMOUNTS OF DEBRIS IN THE AREA (AS WELL AS RECENT SNOWFALL) PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTING DIRECT OBSERVATION OF ALL FACILITY STAKING ALONG COOPER AVENUE."

USIC LOCATING, INC. PERFORMED ONE-CALL LOCATING FOR THE CITY OF KANSAS CITY, MGE AND OTHER UNDERGROUND FACILITY OWNERS.  USIC MARKED THE PRESENCE OF ONE UNDERGROUND ELECTRICAL LINE FOR THE STREETLIGHTS AND ONE UNDERGROUND GAS LINE ABOUT A FOOT TO THE SOUTH OF THE ELECTRICAL LINE.  HOWEVER, THERE ACTUALLY WERE TWO ELECTRICAL LINES AT THAT LOCATION, NOT ONE, ALONG WITH THE GAS LINE ABOUT A FOOT TO THE SOUTH OF THE TWO ELECTRICAL LINES.  HEARTLAND PERSONNEL DUG ONE POTHOLE BETWEEN THE SINGLE RED BROKEN PAINT LINE FOR ONE ELECTRICAL LINE AND THE SINGLE BROKEN YELLOW PAINT LINE FOR THE GAS LINE MARKED ON THE SURFACE AND FOUND TWO CONDUITS.  HEARTLAND CONCLUDED THEY HAD EXPOSED THE ELECTRICAL LINE AND THE GAS LINE THAT USIC HAD MARKED. IN REALITY, HEARTLAND HAD EXPOSED TWO ELECTRICAL CONDUITS AND HAD NOT EXPOSED THE GAS MAIN.  HEARTLAND THEN DIRECTED THE DRILL TO A DEPTH ABOUT A FOOT BELOW THE CONDUITS AND STRUCK THE GAS MAIN.  HEARTLAND FAILED TO EXTEND THE POTHOLE TO THE DEPTH OF THE PLANNED BORE WHERE THE DRILL COULD BE OBSERVED PASSING BELOW THE CONDUITS. THE GAS LINE WAS STRUCK BETWEEN 16:00 AND 16:30, BUT HEARTLAND PERSONNEL DID NOT NOTIFY EMERGENCY PERSONNEL UNTIL THEY CALLED 911 AT 16:54.  MGE DISPATCH WAS NOTIFIED AT 16:55.      IN REFERENCE TO PART A, QUESTION 16, MGE GAVE EVACUATION ORDERS TO TWO STRUCTURES (906 AND 910 W 48TH STREET) PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.    THE EXPLOSION AT JJ'S RESTAURANT, 910 W. 48TH STREET, KANSAS CITY, MO, OCCURRED AT 18:02. THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE WAS CLOSED AT 19:20. THE TWO-INCH GAS MAIN WAS PINCHED OFF AT THE SE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW AT 20:00. AFTER THE GAS FLOW WAS STOPPED, THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET WAS CUT AND CAPPED AT THE NE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW AND JUST WEST OF THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE. THEN, THE GAS MAIN ON BELLEVIEW WAS RE-ENERGIZED TO ALLOW GAS FLOW TO CUSTOMERS ON BELLEVIEW BETWEEN 48TH AND 47TH STREETS. THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET BETWEEN BELLEVIEW AND ROANOKE IS STILL INACTIVE.    ONE FATALITY AND MULTIPLE INJURIES RESULTED, INCLUDING MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER, AND EMPLOYEES OF HEARTLAND AND JJ'S RESTAURANT. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE, BUT THE TOTAL ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME, IN PART BECAUSE LITIGATION CONTINUES INVOLVING THREE BUILDINGS IN THE VICINITY AND ONE ISSUE IN EACH CASE IS THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE EXPLOSION.    MGE HAD SIX EMPLOYEES ON SITE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION. AS MGE WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE A FULL INVESTIGATION ON THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF ITS ON-SITE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT, FIVE OF THE SIX EMPLOYEES WERE SENT TO THE HOSPITAL LATER THAT EVENING FOR DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING. THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING FOR ALL FIVE EMPLOYEES. DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO FOUR OF THE EMPLOYEES, WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS. A DRUG TEST WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER AN ALCOHOL TEST TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE, BUT DID NOT. THE SIXTH EMPLOYEE, MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER, WAS TESTED FOR ALCOHOL AND DRUGS AFTER THE INCIDENT IN THE COURSE OF THE TREATMENT FOR HIS INJURIES AT ST. LUKE'S HOSPITAL, AND THAT THE RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. MGE DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS EMPLOYEES' PERFORMANCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT."

A COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATIVE ARRIVED ON SITE AT 20:02 AND SMELT AN ODOR OF GAS IN THE AIR.  ASSISTANCE OF ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATIVES WAS REQUESTED UPON HIS ARRIVAL.  READINGS WERE TAKEN AND FOUND IN THE STORM DRAINS, IN THE STREET AND INSIDE THE HOME ACROSS THE STREET AT 9 MARPLE RD.  RESIDENTS WERE EVACUATED AT 9 MARPLE ROAD, IN ADDITION TO THE INDIVIDUALS AT 8 MARPLE RD.  ON SITE PERSONNEL AT 20:18 REQUESTED A GAS CREW AND SUPERVISION TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE.  THE POUGHKEEPSIE WATER DEPARTMENT WAS ALSO ON SITE AND ASSISTED CENTRAL HUDSON PERSONNEL IN LOCATING MAN HOLES IN THE AREA TO OPEN AND VENT.    CENTRAL HUDSON GAS CREWS IDENTIFIED A LEAK IN THE STREET BETWEEN THE TWO EVACUATED HOMES OVER THE 6"" LOW PRESSURE STEEL MAIN.  UPON EXCAVATION, A 3/16"" SEPARATION IN A JOINT WAS FOUND AND A 6"" LEAK REPAIR CLAMP WAS INSTALLED TO REPAIR THE LEAK AT 01:30 ON FEBRUARY 9TH.

CENTRAL HUDSON HAS RECEIVED THE RESULTS OF THE LABORATORY TESTING OF THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT.  THE EXTERIOR OF THE PIPE WAS FOUND TO BE IN VERY GOOD CONDITION.     THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE FAILURE OF THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL GROOVE WELD TO BE THE RESULT OF EXTERNAL LOADS EXCEEDING THE CAPABILITIES OF A WELD JOINT THAT EXHIBITED COMPLETE LACK OF PENETRATION SINCE ITS INSTALLATION IN 1931.  EXTERNAL CORROSION WAS NOT A FACTOR, SINCE NONE WAS OBSERVED, INDICATING THE WRAPPING AND CATHODIC PROTECTION OF THIS PIPE WERE SATISFACTORY.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS INCOMPLETE PENETRATION OF THE WELD METAL JOINING THE TWO PIPES. HOWEVER, THE WELD WAS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO REMAIN IN SERVICE FOR OVER 80 YEARS."

HFD DISPATCHER ADVISED THAT THEY RECEIVED A REPORT OF A ""BOOM"" FOLLOWED BY FIRE.  GAS WAS SMELLED IN THE AREA AND OUR CREWS WERE URGENTLY REQUESTED.    OPERATOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM HU GAS DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON SITE AT 2230 (10:30PM CST) ON JANUARY 15, 2013.  HFD AND THE HUNTSVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT (HPD) WERE ON SITE AND HAD EXTINGUISHED A FIRE AT THE PUBLIC HOUSING DWELLING UNIT AT 851 UNIT C WASHINGTON ST AND SECURED THE AREA.  UPON SMELLING NATURAL GAS THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL HELP TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE APPARENT GAS LEAK.    CREWS WERE CALLED IN AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SHUTTING OFF THE SUPPLY OF GAS TO THE ENTIRE PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT AT 0230 (2:30AM CST) ON JANUARY 16, 2013.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT AN UNDERGROUND STEEL DISTRIBUTION VALVE, 2 INCH IN DIAMETER, HAD A CRACKED FLANGE.  THIS LEAK WAS REPAIRED BY REMOVING THE VALVE ALONG WITH ANOTHER SIMILIAR VALVE AND REPLACING IT WITH COATED STEEL PIPE.  THE LEAK WAS TWENTY FEET AWAY FROM THE DWELLING AT 851 WASHINGTON ST.  GAS SERVICE WAS THEN RESTORED TO THE AREA AT 0745 (7:45AM CST) ON JANUARY 16, 2013.      AFTER THE LEAK WAS REPAIRED HU GAS DEPARTMENT CREWS BEGAN TO CONDUCT A NUMBER OF TESTS IN THE VICINTY OF 851 WASHINGTON ST.  THESE TESTS INCLUDED A LEAK SURVEY, CATHODIC PROTECTION PIPE TO SOIL READINGS, BAR HOLE TEST AND A PRESSURE TEST OF ALL THREE GAS SERVICE LINES TO 851 WASHINGTON ST., AS THIS BUILDING WAS A TRI-PLEX COMPRISED OF UNITS A, B, AND C.  ALL THREE GAS SERVICES HELD THE TEST PRESSURE OF APPROXIMATLY +125 PSIG WITH NO LEAKS INDICATED.  A TEST OF THE FUEL LINE (CUSTOMER PIPING) AT UNIT C FAILED, INDICATING A LEAK INSIDE THE UNIT.    AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS ON GOING.  CONTRIBUTING FACTOR(S) MAY HAVE BEEN THE LEAK ON THE FUEL LINE, THE UNDERGROUND GAS LEAK OR SOME OTHER FACTOR.    THE LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WERE A TEMPERATURE OF 37 DEGREES FARENHEIT,  THE WIND SPEED WAS 5 MPH, NO WIND GUSTS, WIND DIRECTION WAS 300 (GENERALLY OUT OF THE NORTHWEST).  IT WAS OVERCAST WITH A LIGHT RAINFALL.    A SUPPLEMENTAL OR SUPPLEMENTAL PLUS FINAL REPORT WILL BE FILED AS SOON AS NEW, UPDATED AND/OR CORRECTED INFORMATION IS KNOWN.    SEPTEMBER 8, 2016-THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT. EXPERT WITNESSES DETERMINED THAT SOMETHING HEAVY LIKE A VEHICLE RAN OVER A VALVE BOX CAUSING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON A 2 INCH FLANGED ROCKWELL FIGURE 143 VALVE CAUSING THE VALVE TO CRACK IN A FLANGE. GAS THEN MIGRATED ALONG A DITCH LINE INTO THE DWELLING CAUSING AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE."

WE SENT OUT OUR SERVICE TECHNICIAN TO RESPOND.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN FOUND THE METER SET LEANING TO THE LEFT SIDE.  THE 3/4"" NIPPLE ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE SERVICE COCK WAS CRACKED.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE PRIOR TO THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ARRIVING.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN REMOVED THE METER AND INSTALLED A RUBBER STOPPER ON THE RISER TO STOP THE GAS LEAK.  THE METER SET WAS INSTALLED ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE WATER HEATER ENCLOSURE.    THE FIRE DESTROYED THE WATER HEATER ENCLOSURE AND BURNED THE EXTERIOR SIDING ON THE 2ND FLOOR.  AS A RESULT OF HFD EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE, 2 UNITS SUSTAINED WATER DAMAGE.    BYSTANDERS REPORTED SEEING KIDS STANDING ON THE METER SET AND JUMPING TO THE FENCE.  THIS WOULD BE A PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION WHY THE METER SET WAS LEANING TO THE LEFT SIDE AND COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE CRACKED NIPPLE.    THE 3/4"" GALVANIZED RISER WAS IN GOOD CONDITION WITH NO NOTICABLE CORROSION.    ACCORDING TO THE HONOLULU FIRE DEPARTMENT'S INCIDENT REPORT (2013-0001443-000), THE ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE IS $35,000.  THE REPORT ALSO NOTES THE PROBABLE CAUSE WAS SOMEONE STEPPED ONTO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE METER ASSEMBLY TRYING TO GET OVER A 6 FOOT WOODEN FENCE.  THE WEIGHT OF THE PERSON CAUSED THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PIPING TO CRACK OPEN, WHICH CREATED A LARGE GAS LEAK.  THE PROPANE FILLED THE SURROUNDING AREA AND EVENTUALLY REACHED THE PILOT LIGHT OF THE GAS WATER HEATERIN THE CLOSET AND IGNITED."

UPON NOTIFICATION, A CHECK WAS PERFORMED ON CUSTOMER FACILITIES, AND NO LEAKAGE WAS FOUND.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION UNCOVERED UNDERGROUND LEAKAGE THAT WAS DETERMINED TO BE COMING FROM A CRACK ON 2' PE PIPING AT A COUPLING FUSION.  FLASHES CAUSED MINOR BURNS TO 2 RESTAURANT CUSTOMERS.  DUE TO SATURATION OF SOIL, AREA COULD NOT BE CLEARED OF A FLAMMABLE MIXTURE, AND RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED.  IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT RESTAURANT WOULD BE ABLE TO REOPEN ON 12/20.  HOWEVER, NATURAL GAS INDICATIONS WERE STILL IN THE VICINITY, AND RESTAURANT WAS NOT ABLE TO REOPEN.  THIS SECOND DAY OF LOSS OF BUSINESS PUT THE ESTIMATED INCIDENT COST AT OVER $50K, TRIGGERING DOT NOTIFICATION.

THE MAINLINE, OWNED AND OPERATED BY AVISTA UTILITIES, WAS OPERATING AT 289 PSIG (300 PSIG - SYSTEM MAOP) AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE EXCAVATOR DIG-IN RESULTED IN BLOWING GAS THAT IGNITED IN EXPLOSION, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN EXCAVATOR BACKFIRE. THE RESULTING FIRE TOTALED THE EXCAVATOR EQUIPMENT INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT AND CAUSED ADDITIONAL DAMAGE TO A RAILROAD CROSS-ARM, AN ADJACENT WAREHOUSE STRUCTURE AND LOCAL ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES (ALSO OWNED AND OPERATED BY AVISTA UTILITIES). IT IS AVISTA'S UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CONTRACTOR WAS OPERATING USING LOCATES FROM A ONE-CALL TICKET THAT HAD EXPIRED 14-DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT AND MARKS WERE NO LONGER FULLY VISIBLE.     AVISTA DISPATCH WAS NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT AT APPROXIMATELY 1335-HOURS. AVISTA PERSONNEL WERE EN-ROUTE BY 1338-HOURS AND ON LOCATION BY 1351-HOURS.

THE INITIAL CALL CAME IN FROM THE ORANGE FIRE DEPARTMENT AT 17:09, AS A HOUSE FIRE AT 272 REOCK AVE, ORANGE; THE FIRE CHIEF STATED GAS WAS NOT INVOLVED, AND THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY SQUATTERS. SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT REVEALED THAT THE FIRE WAS CAUSED WHEN ONE OF THE SQUATTERS LIT A MATCH, WHICH IGNITED LEAKING GAS, ORIGINATING FROM GAS PIPING REMOVED FROM THE HEAD OF AN INSIDE METER SET. THE GAS METER, INLET VALVE AND ASSOCIATED PIPING WERE ALL REMOVED BY AN UNKNOWN PERSON, ON AN UNKNOWN DATE, PRIOR TO THE FIRE.     AN APPLIANCE SERVICE TECH RESPONDED AND SHUT THE GAS OFF AT THE CURB AT 17:40 ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2012. A STREET CREW WAS DISPATCHED, AND THE GAS SERVICE TO 272 REOCK AVE WAS CUT AT THE CURB AT 19:00.    TWO PEOPLE, (NAMES UNKNOWN) SQUATTERS, WERE INJURED, ONE BY THE FIRE, ONE WAS INJURED JUMPING OUT A WINDOW TO ESCAPE THE FIRE.

A JOINT INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED BY THE LOCAL FIRE INVESTIGATOR, AN INVESTIGATOR FROM THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE COMPANY AND A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR HIRED BY ENSTAR.  WHILE THE FIRE STARTED NEAR THE GAS METER, IT'S ORIGIN APPEARED TO BE ELECTRICAL IN NATURE.  A NON GFCI ELECTRICAL OUTLET WAS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE STRUCTURE, NEAR THE GAS METER. PLUGGED INTO THE OUTLET WAS AN UNUSED EXTENSION CORD.  ALSO PLUGGED INTO THE OUTLET WAS A PHOTO VOLTAIC TIMER, A 6 RECEPTACLE POWER STRIP, A SMALL EXTENSION CORD, A STRING OF DECORATIVE PATIO LIGHTS AND A DECORATIVE WATER FOUNTAIN.

THIS RESIDENCE IS A GARAGE APARTMENT BEHIND 410 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH, FL. THE SERVICE TECH FROM FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILTIES ARRIVED AT 11:59 AM AND FOUND THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE TO 410 59TH ST. TURNED OFF AT THE METER BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AS THEY WERE EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE.  THE TECH FOUND THE 3/4"" BARE STEEL NATURAL GAS SERVICE LEAKING UNDER A CONCRETE SLAB AT THE RESIDENCE. FLORIDA PUBLIC UTLITIES DISPATCHED A DISTRIBUTION CREW TO CUT THE SERVICE AT THE MAIN AND CAP IT AT 1:00 PM ON 8/28/12.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT AS A RESULT OF TROPICAL STORM ISAAC, THERE WERE MULTIPLE LIGHTENING STRIKES IN THE AREA OF THE RESIDENCE ON FRIDAY, 8/24/12. NEWS REPORTS STATED THAT THE RESIDENT OF 410.5 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH STARTED SMELLING GAS AROUND THIS TIME. HE DID NOT NOTIFY FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILITIES BUT LOOKED FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR HIMSELF ON TUESDAY, 8/28/12.  ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT IS A PICTURE OF A SECTION OF 3/4"" BARE STEEL SERVICE THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED AT 410 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH. IT APPEARS TO HAVE A HOLE CAUSED BY AN ELECTRICAL ARC.    FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS DETERMINIED THAT THE 3/4"" BS GAS SERVICE WAS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A CAST IRON SEWER LINE AND A GALVANIZED ELECTRICAL CONDUIT. THE ELECTRICAL CONDUIT WAS INSTALLED AT SOME POINT AFTER THE GAS SERVICE WAS INSTALLED WHEN THE GARAGE WAS CONVERTED INTO AN APARTMENT AND A CONCRETE SLAB WAS POURED OVER THEM ON THE GROUND.    STRAY CURRENT EITHER FROM AN ELECTIC POWER POLE OR INDUCED UPON THE  CONDUIT AND PIPING CAUSED AN ARC BETWEEN THE CONDUIT AND PIPES RESULTING IN A SMALL HOLE IN THE GAS PIPING. GAS LEAKED UNDER THE SLAB AS A RESULT OF THE ARC HOLE BEGINNING ON 8/24/12 AND VENTED INTO THE GARAGE APARTMENT. WHEN THE RESIDENT OF 410 59TH ST. BEGAN TO LOOK FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR ON 8/28/12, HE LIT A CIGARETTE, IGNITING THE GAS IN THE APARTMENT.      5/28/2015 - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORT FILED ON 4/28/2014.   1. THE LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE COORDINATES WERE CORRECTED FROM THE ORIGINAL COORDINATES THAT WERE OBTAINED FROM GOOGLE MAPS AND WERE SLIGHTLY INACCURATE.  2. THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS CHANGED FROM G2 - NATURAL FORCE DAMAGE (LIGHTNING) TO G4 - OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE (ELECTRICAL ARCING). ALTHOUGH THERE WAS LIGHTNING IN THE AREA DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, THE EXACT SOURCE OF THE CURRENT THAT ARCED A HOLE IN THE GAS SERVICE COULD NOT BE DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED AFTER AN INVESTIGATION.  3. TOTAL ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS REVIEWED AND LEFT AS STATED. THE DAMAGE AND REMOVAL OF DEBRIS WERE CONFINED TO AN UNPERMITTED AND UNINHABITED DETACHED GARAGE THAT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN APARTMENT. THE REPAIR OF THE GAS MAIN CONSISTED OF INSTALLING A STOP FITTING AND INSERTING APPROX. 100' OF STEEL MAIN WITH PE PIPE AND RUNNING APPROX. 33' OF PE SERVICE. THE ASSESSED VALUE FOR THE ENTIRE PROPERTY AT 410 59TH ST, WEST PALM BEACH WAS $75,210 WITH A MARKET VALUE OF $92,639 IN 2012. THE MEDICAL COSTS FOR THE INJURED PARTY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROPERTY DAMAGE AMOUNT.  4. REFERENCE TO ""ACTIVE LITIGATION"" WAS REMOVED FROM LAST NARRATIVE.  5. CONTACT TITLE, PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS HAVE BEEN UPDATED FOR THE SUBMITTER."

CONTINGENCY CASE 16-A WAS INITIATED AND 4"" REMOTE INLET V-6423 AND 24"" V-6408 WERE INSPECTED FOR CONTINGENCY. A BAR-HOLE SURVEY WAS COMPLETED AND AT 15:02 V-6423 WAS CLOSED ISOLATING APPROXIMATELY 30' OF 178 PSI INLET PIPING TO GR-149. GAS CONTROL REPORTED GR-174 AND GR-141 WERE ALSO SUPPORTING THE AREA AND THERE WAS NO SYSTEM IMPACT FROM ISOLATING GR-149. PRESSURE IN THE AFFECTED SEGMENT WAS REDUCED TO APPROXIMATELY 90 PSI. GAS CONSTRUCTION EXCAVATED AND AT 16:56 A VISIBLE LEAK ON THE BODY OF V-43662 WAS REPORTED. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF A REPAIR CAN BE MADE OR IF THE VALVE WILL BE REPLACED. THE MAIN PRESSURE IN THE AFFECTED SEGMENT WAS REDUCED TO 5 PSI AND THERE WAS A MINOR LEAK WHICH GDS SURVEILLED UNTIL A REPAIR WAS COMPLETED. MULTIPLE REPAIR ATTEMPTS WITH THE CAMERON VALVE REPRESENTATIVE PRESENT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. ON 8-29-12 IT WAS DETERMINED THE VALVE WAS TO BE CUT-OUT AND REPLACED.  ON 9-2-12, V-43662 WAS CUT OUT ON PROCEDURE MPC-12-25 AND REPLACEMENT V-59674 WAS INSTALLED.

THE FIRE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND NO FINAL REPORT HAS BEEN COMPLETED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE FIRE MARSHAL.    UPDATED FEBRUARY 11, 2013:  THIS UPDATE IS BASED PRIMARILY ON THE MINNESOTA STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S INVESTIGATION REPORT.  WE AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION IN THE REPORT THAT THE FIRE WAS ACCIDENTAL.  THE AREA OF ORIGIN FOR THE FIRE WAS INSIDE THE RESIDENCE.  THE FIRST MATERIAL THAT IGNITED WAS NATURAL GAS VAPORS THAT HAD LEECHED INTO THE RESIDENCE AFTER A GAS SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN CRACKED OR BROKEN.  THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF THE LEAK COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE THE RISER AND A SEGMENT OF THE SERVICE WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE.  WHILE THE EXACT IGNITION FACTOR IS NOT KNOWN, ANY APPLIANCE THAT WOULD CYCLE ON OR OFF WOULD LIKELY HAVE PROVIDED SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO IGNITE THE NATURAL GAS/AIR MIXTURE ONCE IT HAD REACHED THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.    WITH RESPECT TO THE BROKEN OR CRACKED GAS SERVICE LINE THAT RESULTED IN THE GAS LEAK, WE KNOW THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THE PRECEDING 4 YEARS, THE RESIDENT HAD FILLED A SINK-TYPE OF HOLE IN THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE HOME THAT WAS ABOVE THE GAS LINE AND NEAR THE METER.  THE SETTLING OF THE SOIL IN THAT HOLE COULD HAVE PUT STRESS ON THE GAS LINE.  IN ADDITION, IN THE DAY (OR DAYS) BEFORE THE FIRE, A MEMBER OF THE RESIDENT'S FAMILY HAD ADDED CLASS FIVE ROCK TO THE TOP OF THE SINK HOLE AREA AND THEN PACKED IT DOWN WITH A BOBCAT, WHICH MAY HAVE ADDED TO OR CREATED STRESS ON THE GAS LINE, POSSIBLY ENOUGH TO CRACK OR BREAK IT AT THAT TIME.  XCEL ENERGY DOES NOT HAVE RECORDS OF THIS CUSTOMER CONTACTING US FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THE SINK HOLE NEAR THE GAS LINE, OR MAKING US AWARE OF ANY RELATED PROBLEMS.  OUR RECORDS REVEAL THAT THE METER LOCATION AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL LOCATION OF THE METER.   WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE METER WAS MOVED BY AN UNKNOWN PARTY, NOT XCEL ENERGY, TO MAKE ROOM FOR A GARAGE ADDITION ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE HOUSE APPROXIMATELY 2007.    THE SERVICE LINE TO THIS LOCATION WILL BE RUN AT THE REQUEST OF THE CUSTOMER AFTER HOME IS REBUILT."

ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT R&W WAS RETIRING A SECTION OF 12 INCH LOW PRESSURE STEEL GAS MAIN ON BROADWAY AT 1ST STREET IN WEST NYACK.  THE 12 INCH MAIN RUNS NORTH AND SOUTH ON BROADWAY AND HAD A RADIAL 4 INCH LOW PRESSURE STEEL MAIN COMING OFF TO THE WEST ON 1ST ST.  R&W EXCAVATED AND EXPOSED THE 12 INCH AND 4 INCH MAIN.   THE BALLOON STOPPERS WERE INFLATED TO 4 PSI TESTED FOR LEAKAGE AND HELD PRESSURE FOR OVER ONE HOUR BEFORE BEING USED.  THEY INSTALLED TWO TAPPING TEES AND FOUR LOW PRESSURE BALLOON STOPPERS INTO THE 12 INCH PIPE AT THE LOCATIONS SHOWN ON THE SKETCH.  THE 4 INCH MAIN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEAD ENDED WITH A CAP FURTHER WEST ALONG 1ST STREET AND DID NOT REQUIRE ANY STOPPERS.  R&W THEN PERFORMED A FLOW TEST TO CONFIRM THAT GAS WAS BEING SUPPLIED TO THE MAIN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ISOLATED SECTION.  THE PRESSURE GAUGES ON THE BALLOON STOPPERS WERE CHECKED TO CONFIRM THAT THE STOPPERS WERE HOLDING AND THAT THE SECTION WAS EFFECTIVELY ISOLATED.  R&W CUT THE 12 INCH PIPE ON THE NORTH END OF THE EXCAVATION WITH A REED 4 WHEEL PIPE CUTTER.  THEY THEN MADE TWO CUTS WITH A DEMO SAW ON THE 4 INCH STEEL MAIN, REMOVING A 4 INCH RING.    R&W USED AN ORBITAL CUTTER AND TORCH TO BEVEL CUT THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE 12 INCH MAIN.   THE CREW MADE A SECOND CUT AND REMOVED ABOUT A 4 INCH RING AT THE SOUTHERLY END OF THE 12 INCH PIPE.  WHEN THE RINGS WERE CUT R&W HAD SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE AND THE CUT OUT SECTION WAS REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION.  R&W SET UP THE ORBITAL CUTTER TO BEVEL THE ROUGH CUT ON THE NORTH END OF THE 12 INCH MAIN.  THE CONTRACTOR'S WELDER AND CREW FOREMAN WERE IN THE EXCAVATION AND BEGAN TO MAKE THE BEVEL CUT.  AT 16:28, WHEN THEY HAD FLAME CUT APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE, THE NORTHERLY BALLOON STOPPERS FAILED AND THE LEAKING GAS IGNITED.  BOTH MEN EXITED THE EXCAVATION AND WERE NOT INJURED BY THE IGNITION OR THE ENSUING GAS FED FIRE.  THE THREE REGULATOR STATIONS SUPPLYING THE AFFECTED AREA WERE TURNED OFF AND THE RESIDUAL GAS BURNED OFF.  APPROXIMATELY 385 GAS SERVICES WERE INTERRUPTED.  OVERHEAD ELECTRIC FACILITIES IN THE AREA WERE DE-ENERGIZED INTERRUPTING APPROXIMATELY 650 SERVICES.  ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS RESTORED AT APPROXIMATELY 20:40 THAT EVENING.

WE ARE RESUBMITTING TO CLOSE AND FINALIZE THE REPORT    AN EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE OCCURRED ON MAY 13TH 2012 AT 23:53 AT 36 S. UTAH STREET, NEWARK OHIO, 43055.  MICHAEL CLARK OF THE RESIDENCE HAD JUST ENTERED HIS GARAGE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED, HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN SPECULATED THAT HE WAS ENTERING THE GARAGE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE.  TWO OTHER RESIDENTS WERE HOME AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE, DAKNEEKA PALMER, THE FIANCE OF MICHAEL CLARK, AND THEIR 9-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER, LEGACEE.  BOTH ESCAPED THE HOUSE UNHARMED.  THE ENERGY COOP WAS CONTACTED BY THE LICKING COUNTY 911 DISPATCHER AT 01:34 (5/14/12 - 1 HOUR 41 MINUTES AFTER THE EXPLOSION) TO RESPOND TO THE SITE TO ENSURE GAS WAS OFF TO THE STRUCTURE.  TWO ENERGY COOP EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHES, A LEAKAGE INSPECTOR MICHAEL CARR AND A SERVICE TECH TOM COOPER.  TOM ARRIVED 02:05 AND MIKE ARRIVED AT 02:20.  THEY VERIFIED GAS WAS OFF AND BEGAN A LEAKAGE INVESTIGATION.  AT 3:05, A LEAK WAS FOUND UNDER THE 20' WIDE APPROACH APRON OF THE DRIVEWAY AT 36 S. UTAH.  THE LEAKAGE EXTENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND THE DECISION TO SHUT THE MAIN DOWN ALONG WITH 8 CUSTOMERS WAS MADE.  THE VALVE TO SHUT THE LINE DOWN WAS TURNED AT 05:26 HOURS.  THE 2"" MAIN LINE SERVICING THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND CUT ON THE NORTH END AND SOUTH END OUTSIDE OF THE LEAKAGE AREA.  APPROXIMATELY 250' OF 2"" PLASTIC MAIN LINE WAS INSTALLED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF UTAH AVENUE.  THE NEW LINE WAS TIE BACK INTO THE EXISTING LINE IN A MANNER THAT ISOLATED THE GAS MAIN IN THE LEAKAGE AREA.  THE OLD LINE WAS CAPPED TO PRESERVE THE LINE FOR FURTHER TESTING.  GAS SERVICE WAS REESTABLISHED TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  ODORANT READINGS WERE TAKEN AND FOUND TO BE WELL WITHIN REQUIRED LIMITS.  THE REMAINDER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SURVEYED FOR LEAKAGE TO ENSURE THE AREA WAS SAFE AS IT RELATED TO GAS SERVICE.  AT 09:00 ON MAY 16TH , 2012 WE RETURNED TO THE SITE TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE ISOLATED MAIN LINE AT NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE (43#) TO TEST FOR LEAKAGE.  WE FOUND LEAKAGE ON THE ISOLATED 191' OF 2"" BARE STEEL.  WE ISOLATED APPROXIMATELY 90' NORTH OF THE 36 S. UTAH DRIVEWAY AND PRESSURE TESTED IT.  WE FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE TESTED THE SOUTHERN SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 100') AND FOUND LEAKAGE.  WE EXCAVATED TO EXPOSE THE MAIN LINE JUST SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY TO 36 S. UTAH AND CUT THE MAIN TO ISOLATE APROXIMATELY 45' THAT WAS UNDER THE DRIVE WAY.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE 65'SECTION SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE SERVICE LINE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STRUCTURE AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  THIS ISOLATED THE LEAKAGE TO THE 45' SECTION LOCATED UNDER THE DRIVEWAY.  WE CUT THE CONCRETE AND PUT PRESSURE ON THE PIPING AND DETERMINED THERE WERE 2 LEAKAGE AREAS APPROXIMATELY 12' APPART UNDER THE EXISTING 20' CONCRETE DRIVEWAY."

OF A WORKING FIRE AT 4213 S 13TH ST.. DISTRICT PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND ASSISTED THE OFD IN SHUTTING OFF THE GAS TO THIS RESIDENCE. IT WAS THEN DETERMINED THAT IT APPEARD THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL OF A NATURAL GAS EXPLOSION/IGNITION THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT/LOSS. THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE IGNITION SOURCE OR THE AREA WHERE GAS MAY HAVE BEEN RELEASED HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED AS OF YET. ON 3/14/12 THERE WILL BE A COMBINED INVESTIGATION WITH SEVERAL PARTIES OF INTEREST TO TRY AND LOCATE THE ORIGIN OF THE LEAK AND OR THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS.      10/11/12- OUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE COCK VALVE ON THE INSIDE OF THE DWELLING HAD A LEAK IN THE PACKING AND THE GAS ESCAPED THE COCK VALVE AND MIGRATED TOWARDS THE FURNACE AREA OF THE DWELLING. DUE TO THE HOUSE BEING VACANT AND VENELATION WAS MINIMAL THERE ENDED UP BEING A BUILD UP IN THE FURNACE AREA AND WHEN THE FURNACE CYCLED IT IGNITED THE GAS AND THE RESULT OF THIS IGNITION WAS THE LOSS OF THIS DWELLING. THE GAS SERVICE TO THE DWELLING WAS ABANDONED AT THE MAIN ON THE DAY OF THE LOSS AND THE DWELLING SINCE HAS BEEN TORN DOWN DUE TO THE LOSS.    10/22/12- THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE INSIDE METER, THE OPERATOR OWNED COCK VALVE LEAKED IN THE PACKING AND RELEASED NATURAL GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THE NATURAL GAS THAT WAS RELEASED, WHICH WAS THE FUEL SOURCE,IGNITED WHEN THE FURNACE CYCLED AND THE RESULT WAS THE LOSS THAT WAS BEEN REPORTED.  OUR INVESTIGATION IS CLOSED IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER AND THIS ENTRY SHALL SERVE AS OUR FINAL ENTRY IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER.     11/10/14- MUD HAS CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AND, AS A RESULT, NOW DRAWS A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION THAN PREVIOUSLY ENTERED ON THIS REPORT. AS A RESULT OF THIS CONTINUED INVESTIGATION, MUD BELIEVES THAT THE PRIMARY GAS SOURCE THAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE WAS THE INLET SWIVEL AND NOT THE GAS COCK VALVE. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED UPON THE CONDITION OF THE METER, THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIRE WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MUD PERSONAL ARRIVED ON SCENE AND MUD EMPLOYEE'S EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GAS AND GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. MUD BELIEVES THAT THE ONLY WAY THE INLET SWIVEL COULD HAVE HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS FOR THE INLET SWIVEL TO HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY LOOSENED FROM THE GAS METER. MUD BELIEVES THAT THE GAS COCK VALVE MOST LIKELY BECAME LOOSENED AS A RESULT OF THE EXTREME HEAT FROM THE INITIAL EXPLOSION AND RESULTING FIRE BUT THAT THE GAS COCK VALVE DID NOT CAUSE THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE. MUD'S INVESTIGATION IS NOW CLOSED WITH RESPECT TO THIS MATTER AND IS THE SUBJECT OF ONGOING LITIGATION BETWEEN THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE PROVIDER AND MUD."

WESTCHESTER GAS CONSTRUCTION AND ADDITIONAL CREWS RESPONDED AND CONTINGENCY VALVES WERE LOCATED. THE LEAK WAS INVESTIGATED AND TWO EXCAVATIONS OVER THE PARALLEL 16"" HP STEEL DISTRIBUTION MAIN REVEALED NO LEAKS. THE CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR REPORTED THAT IN THE SECOND EXCAVATION VISIBLE WATER BUBBLING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE TRANSMISSION MAIN 30' NORTH OF THE NORTH BUILDING LINE OF # 1060 KNOLLWOOD RD. INDICATED A PROBABLE LEAK ON THE TRANSMISSION MAIN. CREWS CEASED EXCAVATING, AND THE LEAK DID NOT POSE AN IMMEDIATE HAZARD TO LIFE OR PROPERTY. CONTINGENCY VALVES WERE STAFFED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, AND THE EXCAVATION MONITORED FOR SAFETY.     AN OPERATIONAL PLAN WAS DEVELOPED WHICH INVOLVED PRESSURE REDUCTION, ISOLATION OF THE AFFECTED SECTION AND SUBSEQUENT HAND EXCAVATION TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK. AN OPERATIONAL PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ISOLATE THE TRANSMISSION MAIN TO REPAIR THE LEAK. ON MARCH 7, 2012 AT 10:03 HRS., THE TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS ISOLATED VIA SHUTDOWN AND PRESSURE REDUCTION BEGAN. AT 10:34 HRS., PRESSURE WAS REDUCED TO 60 PSI. THE MAIN WAS EXCAVATED AND AT 15:55 HRS. A VISUAL LEAK ON A 12"" COMPRESSION COUPLING WAS CONFIRMED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK. THE MAIN WAS ABATED AND A WELDED REPAIR SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED TO SECURE THE LEAK. ALL TESTING OF THE SLEEVE WERE SUCCESSFUL. ON MARCH 8, 20112, PRESSURE RESTORATION IN THIS SEGMENT OF MAIN BEGAN AT 03:00 HRS. THE MAIN PRESSURE WAS RESTORED INCREMENTALLY AND LEAK SURVEY CHECKED THE SEGMENT OF MAIN INVOLVED AT EACH PRESSURE INCREASE. NO LEAKS WERE FOUND. AT 07:18 HRS.

VECTREN PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED THE VALVE TO THE SERVICE LINE PROVIDING NATURAL GAS TO THE STRUCTURE.     AN INITIAL REPORT FROM THE FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THE STRUCTURE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS 'TOTALLY DESTROYED AND REDUCED TO A FLAMING PILE OF RUBBLE'.  IT FURTHER DESCRIBED THE DAMAGE TO ADJACENT STRUCTURES INCLUDING BLOWN OUT WINDOWS, A COLLAPSED EXTERIOR WALL AND SMALL AMOUNTS OF FIRE TO THE ROOF LINES.     THE INITIAL REPORT ALSO COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE CAUSE REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION, THE PRELIMINARY THOUGHT IS THAT 'EXCAVATION WORK AROUND A NATURAL GAS LINE CAUSED THE LINE TO FRACTURE ON THE INSIDE OF THE BASEMENT WALL'' 'ALLOWING THE FREE FLOW OF GAS TO FILL THE INTERIOR OF THE STRUCTURE AND A UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE SPARKED THE EXPLOSION.'    VECTREN IS CONTINUING ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN OF THIS INCIDENT.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT NARRATIVE, JANUARY 10, 2012:    THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE FOR THE DUPLEX AT 367-369 WAYNE DRIVE RAN UNDERGROUND FROM THE CURB BOX THROUGH THE CONCRETE BASEMENT WALL INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  AFTER GOING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE BASEMENT WALL, THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE THEN WENT TO THE LEFT AT A TEE CONNECTION TO THE METER FOR 367 WAYNE DRIVE AND THEN TO THE RIGHT AT AN NINETY DEGREE ELBOW THROUGH THE BLOCK WALL, DIVIDING THE BASEMENTS, TO THE METER FOR 369 WAYNE DRIVE.      VECTREN GENERALLY CONCLUDES THAT THE BACKHOE OPERATOR, DIGGING A TRENCH OUTSIDE THE BASEMENT FOUNDATION BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE DUPLEX, DAMAGED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE.  THIS DAMAGE CAUSED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE TO BEND AND PULL AND TO PLACE A LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION ON THE GAS SERVICE LINE AND THE THREADS THAT SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW INSIDE THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THIS LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION CAUSED THE THREADS OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE, WHICH WERE SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW, TO FRACTURE AT THIS THREAD JOINT RELEASING NATURAL GAS INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THE NATURAL GAS EXPLODED FROM AN UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE ONCE THE NATURAL GAS AND AIR MIXTURE HAD REACHED A POINT BETWEEN THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT AND THE UPPER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.  THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION DID NOT CAUSE THE FRACTURE TO THIS THREAD JOINT.      VECTREN'S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE PROPER AMOUNT OF MERCAPTAN OR ODORANT WAS IN THE NATURAL GAS AT THE TIME AND THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER NATURAL GAS LEAKS.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND LEAK TIGHT.  VECTREN'S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO REQUESTS TO LOCATE THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE BEFORE THESE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS AND THAT THERE WAS NO REQUEST TO TURN OFF THE NATURAL GAS.

THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCEDURE WAS TO DISPOSE OF A BUILD-UP OF NATURAL GAS (DETERMINED LATER TO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN A MIXTURE OR AIR AND GAS) IN THE 22-INCH PIPELINE BY TRANSFERRING IT AT 10 PSIG INTO MICHCON'S GRAND RAPIDS/WALKER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM RATHER THAN RELEASING IT TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND FLARING (BURNING) THE GAS.  THE PROCEDURE WAS EXECUTED PRECISELY AS WRITTEN AND APPROVED BY MICHCON ENGINEERING.    AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 AM, WHILE THE PRESSURE REDUCTION PROCEDURE WAS STILL IN PROGRESS, MICHCON BEGAN TO RECEIVE ""NO-GAS"" REPORTS FROM CUSTOMERS SERVED BY THE SURROUNDING 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 AM, MICHCON PERSONNEL REALIZED THERE HAD BEEN AN AIR AND GAS MIXTURE IN THE 22-INCH PIPELINE, RATHER THAN GAS.  PRESSURE REDUCTION OPERATIONS WERE HALTED IMMEDIATELY.    MICHCON ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY CONVENED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED AREA AND THE SOURCE OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE.  MICHCON DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY 5500 CUSTOMERS OVER AN AREA OF ABOUT 10 SQUARE MILES COULD ULTIMATELY BE AFFECTED.  HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE INITIAL OUTAGE REPORTS AT 10:15 AM AND THE EARLY AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 17, THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 100 ""NO-GAS"" REPORTS.  THIS NUMBER GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 350 OUTAGE REPORTS BY 8 PM AS CUSTOMERS RETURNED HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY.  AT 8 PM MICHCON MANAGEMENT DECLARED THIS A ""SIGNIFICANT EVENT"" AND A TELEPHONIC REPORT WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.     CREWS WERE MOBILIZED FROM MICHCON REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN TO MAKE A DOOR-TO-DOOR INVESTIGATION OF EVERY CUSTOMER PREMISES IN THE AFFECTED AREA TO ENSURE THAT GAS SERVICE WAS BEING RESTORED AND THAT ALL APPLIANCES WERE OPERATING PROPERLY.  MICHCON ENGINEERS DEVELOPED A PLAN TO SYSTEMATICALLY PURGE THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE FROM THE 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, AND INDIVIDUAL SERVICE LINES WERE PURGED OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE WHEREVER IT WAS FOUND.  BY FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2011, EVERY CUSTOMER HAD EITHER BEEN CONTACTED OR THEIR PREMISES WERE ENTERED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCKSMITHS TO CONFIRM THAT GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN RESTORED.  THERE WERE NO FIRES, EXPLOSIONS, OR INJURIES REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.    MICHCON HAS DETERMINED THE FORMATION OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE INSIDE THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF THE 22-INCH 238 PSIG PIPELINE BEGAN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SEGMENT WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE DURING AUGUST 2011.  THE 22-INCH PIPELINE HAD BEEN SHUT IN BETWEEN MICHCON'S SOUTH GRAND RAPIDS GATE STATION TO THE WEST AND THE NEW COLLINDALE REGULATING STATION ON THE EAST END OF THE 22-INCH PIPELINE SEGMENT.  THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF PIPELINE HAD BEEN EVACUATED AND PURGED OF GAS, THEN CAPPED OFF AT THE COLLINDALE REGULATING STATION SITE WHILE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATION WAS COMPLETED.     A 22-INCH BLOCK VALVE AT THE SOUTH GRAND RAPIDS GATE STATION THAT WAS USED TO ISOLATE THE WEST END OF THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE ALLOWED GAS TO SLOWLY BLEED PAST THE VALVE SEAT, MIXING WITH THE AIR LEFT IN THE PURGED SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER 2011.  THE MICHCON ENGINEER WHO DEVELOPED THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE FOR OCTOBER 17 RECOGNIZED THAT THE GAS BLEEDING THROUGH THE 22-INCH BLOCK VALVE WAS CREATING A PRESSURE BUILD-UP, BUT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THIS WOULD CREATE AN AIR/GAS MIXTURE THAT WOULD BE UNFIT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO CUSTOMERS.

THE CREW CONSISTED OF A DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER AND A SERVICE TECHNICIAN. THE CREW EXCAVATED AND EXPOSED A 6-INCH CAST IRON DISTRIBUTION MAIN OPERATING AT 5 PSIG.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER, WHILE WEARING A SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR, PREPARED THE CAST IRON MAIN FOR INSTALLATION OF A 6-INCH BY 9-INCHES IN LENGTH PIPE REPAIR CLAMP.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER INSTALLED THE CLAMP AND TIGHTENED THE BOLTS TO STOP THE LEAK.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER REMOVED THE SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR FOR UNKNOWN REASONS. THEREAFTER, HE PROCEEDED TO FINISH TIGHTENING THE BOLTS AND SOAP CHECK THE PIPE TO VERIFY THAT THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.  AT THAT TIME, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN LEFT THE TOP OF THE EXCAVATION AND WENT TO THE TRUCK TO RETRIEVE COATING FOR THE REPAIR CLAMP WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF GAS BLOWING FROM THE EXCAVATION.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE EXCAVATION AND FOUND THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER KNEELING FACE DOWN OVER THE GAS MAIN AND UNRESPONSIVE TO VERBAL COMMANDS.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO RETRIEVE THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO AND CALLED 911.  GROSSE POINTE FARMS POLICE AND EMS PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND PULLED THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION; HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL IN DETROIT, MI WHERE HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD.  A SECOND REPAIR CREW WAS CALLED IN TO REPAIR THE GAS MAIN FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT AND INSTALLED A 6-INCH BY 12-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP ADJACENT TO THE FIRST REPAIR CLAMP;  HOWEVER THE CLAMP FURTHER CRUSHED THE CORRODED/WEAKENED PIPE.   BOTH REPAIR CLAMPS WERE REMOVED AND A 6-INCH BY 30-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP WAS INSTALLED TO REPAIR THE LEAK.     ON NOVEMBER 1, 2011, THE PIPE WAS REMOVED AND RECOVERED FOR EXAMINATION AND A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS BY A THIRD PARTY LABORATORY.  THE ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT LOCALIZED GRAPHITIC CORROSION WEAKENED THE FRACTURED PIECES OF PIPE THAT WERE CRUSHED WHEN TIGHTENING THE REPAIR CLAMPS."

AROUND THIS SAME TIME, A PG&E GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (GSR) OBSERVED SMOKE WHILE DRIVING NEARBY AND WENT TO THE SCENE.  THE GSR OBSERVED A HOUSE STRUCTURE ON FIRE AS WELL AS FLAMES IN THE LANDSCAPE AREA IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.  THE HOMEOWNER INDICATED SHE NOTICED THE SMELL OF GAS AT APPROXIMATELY 0800 HOURS THAT MORNING BUT DID NOT THINK MUCH ABOUT IT AND LEFT HER RESIDENCE AT APPROXIMATELY 1130 HOURS.  THE HOMEOWNER DID NOT NOTIFY PG&E OF THE OBSERVED SMELL OF GAS.  A GAS CONSTRUCTION CREW ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 1251 HOURS, AND THE FLOW OF GAS WAS STOPPED BY EXCAVATING AND SQUEEZING THE PLASTIC MAIN AT THREE LOCATIONS. GAS SERVICE WAS INTERRUPTED TO SEVEN CUSTOMERS.  SERVICE TO ONE AFFECTED RESIDENCE WAS RESTORED WHEN STRUCTURE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED.  SERVICE TO THE REMAINING SIX CUSTOMERS WERE RESTORED BY 1400 HOURS ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2011.  EXCAVATION OF THE PLASTIC GAS DISTRIBUTION MAIN REVEALED A CRACK IN A 2-INCH ALDYL A PLASTIC TEE, WHICH WAS THE SOURCE OF THE GAS LEAK.  THE TEE FAILED AS A RESULT OF STRESS RISERS FORMED IN THE TEE MATERIAL FROM THE STEPWISE INCREASE IN WALL THICKNESS WHERE THE COUPLING AND SERVICE PIPE FIRST BOND.  THE FRACTURE PROPOGATED BY SLOW CRACK GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE SYSTEM PRESSURE.  GAS FROM THE LEAKING TEE MIGRATED UNDERGROUND TO THE GARAGE OF THE RESIDENCE AND CAUGHT FIRE FROM THE PILOT LIGHT OF THE FURNACE IN THE GARAGE. PG&E CONDUCTED LEAK SURVEYS AT THE 422 TOWNHOUSE COMPLEX WHERE 20299 NORTHWEST SQUARE IS LOCATED IN APRIL AND MAY OF 2011.  A REVIEW OF THE LEAK SURVEY RECORDS DID NOT REVEAL ANY ISSUES AT THIS RESIDENCE, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE LEAKS DETECTED IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COMPLEX.  LEAK SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, AND SIX LEAKS WERE IDENTIFIED AND REPAIRED THROUGHOUT THE COMPLEX.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES. HOWEVER, DAMAGE TO THE HOUSE STRUCTURE EXCEEDS $50,000, MAKING THIS INCIDENT REPORTABLE.  IN ADDITION, MAJOR BAY AREA TV MEDIA WAS ON THE SCENE."

A FIRE, UNRELATED TO NATURAL GAS, WAS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT.  THE TOTAL DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED TO BE MORE THAN $50,000.  THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED, BUT THE FIRE DEPT. HAS RULED THAT WAS NOT THE INITIATING CAUSE OF THE EVENT.  THE CITY OF RICHMOND PERFORMED A SERIES OF TESTS WHICH INCLUDED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE OUTER PERIMETER OF THE BUILDING, BAR HOLE TEST, AND A PRESSURE TEST OF THE GAS SERVICE.  DURING THE FIRE, THE RISER, REGULATOR, AND METER WERE DESTROYED, WHICH CAUSED A LEAK ON THE RISER THAT SHOWED UP DURING THE PRESSURE TEST OF THE SERVICE.  A TEST OF THE RISER DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE HEAT FROM THE FIRE.  ALSO, THE CITY OF RICHMOND, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITIES, HAD AN ODOROMETER TEST PERFORMED BY THE SUPERVISOR OF PRESSURE CONTROL AND FOUND THE ODORANT TO BE IN THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE."

THE EXCAVATOR THEN PROCEEDED TO USE A BACKHOE TO EXCAVATE A TRENCH PARALLEL TO BUT NOT ADJACENT TO THE MAIN WITHOUT FURTHER EXPOSING THE GAS PIPE.    THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE EXCAVATOR'S FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROBE FOR THE MAIN AND APPURTENANCES AS HE PROGRESSED AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL EXPOSED SECTION IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE MAIN.  NEW JERSEY CODE REQUIRES PROPER CARE AND ADEQUATE SUPERVISION BE USED TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE UNDERGROUND FACILITY AFTER LOCATING THE FACILITY BY HAND (REF. N.J.A.C.14-2-3.3).  THE CLOSE PROXIMITY AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE DAMAGED FACILITY SUGGESTS NO CLOSE SUPERVISION OF THE MECHANICAL EXCAVATION WAS BEING PRACTICED ALTHOUGH THE EXCAVATOR KNEW THE EXCAVATION WAS BEING PERFORMED WITHIN INCHES OF THE GAS MAIN AND ITS LIKELY APPURTENANCES.

THE AREA OF WORK WAS LEFT PLATED AND SECURED OVERNIGHT. ON APRIL 19, 2011, THE LOCATION WAS SURVEILLED DURING AN INSPECTION OF THE PIPING AND A LEAK CONDITION WAS FOUND. AN OPERATIONAL PLAN WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED WAS IMPLEMENTED AFTER A LEAK ON A 1"" DRIP RISER COMPRESSION COUPLING AT THE INLET OF THIS REGULATOR STATION WAS DETECTED.  THE PLAN CALLED FOR ISOLATION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF GR-498 (212 PSI INLET) WHICH SUPPLIES A 60 PSI HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS AT SCENE.  HOUSE WAS IN FLAMES AND FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS USING HOSES TO CONTROL FIRE.  WHEN IT WAS SAFE, CREW APPROACHED OUTSIDE RISER TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS BROKEN ABOVE OR BELOW THE SHUT OFF VALVE.  THE ENTIRE METER ASSEMBLY WAS BURIED WITH SNOW, ICE AND ASH WHEN THEY APPROACHED.  07:45 GAS WAS SHUT OFF AT RISER USING A LONG HANDLED VALVE KEY.  THIS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE FLAMES HOWEVER DID NOT STOP THE FIRE.

FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION:    IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT THE SUBSEQUENT ACTION WAS TAKEN:    - A GAS SAMPLE WAS TAKEN AT THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE (501 CAYUGA ST) TO CHECK MERCAPTIN LEVELS.  TWO TESTS WERE COMPLETED USING BACKARACH ODOROMETER (ID# AIS367).  THE RESULTS WERE:  - .15 (TESTED BY ANDY HECKATHORN)  - .25 (TESTED PHILIP NATOLI)  - ABOVE GROUND SERVICE PIPING, INCLUDING CUSTOMER FUEL LINE, WAS INSPECTED FOR DAMAGE.  THE ENTIRE METER ASSEMBLY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BENT FORWARD.  THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE REGULATOR, AND METER DUE TO THE FIRE.  CUSTOMER FUEL LINE WAS VERY LOOSE BUT STILL INTACT.  A CRACK WAS FOUND ON THE NIPPLE BETWEEN THE REDUCER AND THE BOTTOM OF THE SHUT OFF VALVE.  - SERVICE RISER WAS CAPPED, AND LINE WAS RE-ENERGIZED.  AN UNDERGROUND LEAK SURVEY WAS COMPLETED USING TWO CALIBRATED COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATORS (ID #052010 AND #052010).  ZERO GAS READINGS WERE FOUND.  - THE SERVICE LINE WAS PRESSURE TESTED WITH AIR AT 22PSI FOR 15 MINUTES, WITH NO DROP IN LINE PRESSURE.  - AFTER TESTING WAS COMPLETED, THE SERVICE LINE WAS PERMANENTLY RETIRED AT THE MAIN.  - JIM CLARY FROM THE NG CLAIMS DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS DENNIS WARE FROM WARE INVESTIGATIONS ARRIVED TO INVESTIGATE AND DOCUMENT THE EVENT.    PRELIMINARY REPORT:    CONSENSUS WITH THE LOCAL FIRE AND POLICE INVESTIGATORS AS WELL AS NG PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT ICE AND SNOW SHED FROM THE ROOF OF THE RESIDENCE CAUSED THE DAMAGE TO THE SERVICE PIPING RESULTING IN THE LEAK.  THE MOST LIKELY IGNITION SOURCE OCCURRED FROM THE FURNACE WHICH WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET FROM THE SERVICE RISER."

THE CUSTOMER AT THIS FACILITY HAD REMOVED SNOW ACCUMULATED ON THE ROOF OUT OF CONCERN THAT THE SNOW LOAD WOULD COLLAPSE THE ROOF. THE SNOW WAS REMOVED FROM THE ROOF AND DEPOSITED ON THE GROUND SURROUNDING THE BUILDING INCLUDING THE METER LOCATION. WHEN COMPANY PERSONNEL ARRIVED ONSITE THE SNOW AT THE METER SET WAS 10 FEET HIGH.    THE FORCE OF THE SNOW BEING DROPPED FROM THE ROOF STRESSED THE PIPING FROM THE METER VALVE AT THE TOP OF THE SERVICE RISER TO THE REGULATOR CAUSING THE THREADED NIPPLE TO CRACK AT THE THREADS.

HE NOTIFIED THE FRUITLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND PUT OUT THE REMAINING HOT SPOTS AND COOL DOWN THE STRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT. FIRE WAS DETECTED AROUND THE SERVICE RISER TO THE BUILDING AND WE WERE NOTIFIED BY WICOMICO COUNTY 911 CENTER. OUR ON-CALL METER TECH RESPONDED AND NOTED THAT THE GREASE HAD MELTED OUT OF THE 3/4"" SERVICE STOP AND DETECTED THE SMELL OF GAS. HE NOTICED THAT SOME GAS WAS BUBBLING THROUGH THE WATER FROM THE SERVICE RISER NEAR THE FENCE. HE CALLED OUT OUR ON-CALL CONSTRUCTION CREW WHO HAND DUG AROUND THE RISER AND SQUEEZED OFF THE 3/4"" PE SERVICE AND CAPPED IT OFF. THEY DUG THE RISER OUT AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE SHOP FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THE INSERTED TUBE WAS CUT OFF THE RISER AND SHOWED A SMALL PINHOLE THAT HAD FORMED DUE TO THE HEAT. THE GAS FROM THE PINHOLE TRAVELLED DOWN THE CASING PIPE AND OUT THE BOOT AND VENTED THROUGH THE GROUND AND WATER PUDDLES BUT DID NOT IGNITE. MARYLAND STATE FIRE MARSHALL S. P. MASON INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENT AND CONCLUDED THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE WAS AN EXTENSION CORD GOING TO A BATTERY TRICKLE CHARGER ON A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN THE STRUCTURE AND THAT NATURAL GAS WAS NOT A CAUSE. THE BUILDING CONTAINED A BACKHOE, SEVERAL TRACTORS, COMPRESSORS, ZERO-TURN LAWN MOWERS, ETC. WHICH WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE.

GAS IS SUPPLIED THROUGH THREE DISTRICT REGULATOR STATIONS FROM THE NORTHEAST, EAST AND SOUTHWEST AREAS OF THE VILLAGE.  THESE THREE STATIONS CONTAIN TWO CONTROL/MONITOR REGULATORS SET AT 6.5 OUNCES (OZ) AND 8.5 OUNCES PER SQUARE INCH GAUGE RESPECTIVELY.  THE NORTHEAST STATION IS EQUIPPED WITH A HI-LO FOR MONITORING SYSTEM PRESSURE THAT IS SET AT 8.5 OZ AND 4.5 OZ RESPECTIVELY.  THE EAST STATION ALSO CONTAINS A RELIEF DEVICE FOR AUDIBLE WARNING SET AT 12OZ.      AT APPROXIMATELY 6:37 A.M. ON 01/24/2011, DOMINION RECEIVED A HIGH ALARM FROM THE HI-LO MONITOR AT THE NORTHEAST STATION.    A TECHNICIAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA.  THE TECHNICIAN NOTED THE RELIEF BLOWING AS HE PASSED THE EAST STATION AND NOTIFIED SUPERVISION.  THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT THE NORTHEAST STATION AT 7:15 A.M., AND SHUT THE INLET VALVE TO THE NORTHEAST STATION.  HE PROCEEDED TO THE EAST STATION, SHUT THE INLET VALVE AND OBTAINED A SYSTEM PRESSURE READING OF 8.5 PSIG.  SUPERVISION WAS UPDATED THAT THE NORTHEAST AND EAST STATIONS WERE NOT SUPPLYING GAS, AND BOTH STATIONS HAD BEEN SHUT-IN.    SUPERVISION ADVISED THE TECHNICIAN TO OPEN THE INLET TO THE EAST STATION AND PROCEED TO THE SOUTHWEST STATION.  UPON ARRIVAL HE NOTED THE SOUTHWEST STATION WAS SUPPLYING GAS AND SHUT THE INLET VALVE.  SUPERVISION ADVISED HIM TO RETURN TO THE EAST STATION AND MONITOR THE SYSTEM PRESSURE.  AT 8:05 A.M. THE TECHNICIAN RETURNED TO THE EAST STATION AND NOTED THE RELIEF HAD STOPPED BLOWING.  HE VERIFIED THAT SYSTEM PRESSURE HAD RETURNED TO 6.5OZ.      LEAK SURVEY OF THE FAIRPORT HARBOR SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED ON 01/24/2011 AND REPEATED ON 01/25/2011.  CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE CREWS REPAIRED ALL HAZARDOUS LEAKS UPON DISCOVERY AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON REPAIR OF NON-HAZARDOUS LEAKS.      DOMINION FIELD PERSONNEL REMAINED IN THE AREA OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS, RESTORING SERVICE TO 1300 AFFECTED CUSTOMERS.  DOMINION HAS WORKED WITH FAIRPORT HARBOR VILLAGE OFFICIALS AND THE AMERICAN RED CROSS PROVIDING HOUSING AND SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THOSE IN NEED UNTIL SERVICE RESTORATION.  ELEVEN HOMES RECEIVED SEVERE DAMAGE FROM FIRE AND 150 HOMES REQUIRED APPLIANCE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT.  DOMINION AND ITS CONTRACTORS HAVE PROVIDED ALL NECESSARY HOUSE LINE REPAIRS, APPLIANCE REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENT.  FOR NINE STRUCTURES CONSIDERED TO BE UNINHABITABLE, DOMINION CONTINUES TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS OF RESOLVING CUSTOMER CLAIMS.      DOMINION WORKED WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF OHIO, FAIRPORT HARBOR FIRE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATORS AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IN REMOVING THE REGULATORS AND OTHER ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT FROM THE SOUTHWEST STATION.  THE STATION EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE GAS TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE (GTI) FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATION.    AFTER GTI REMOVED AN OILY SUBSTANCE AND CLEANED THE COMPONENTS WITH ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL, THE REGULATORS INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WERE TESTED IN JUNE AND AUGUST WITH ALL OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES PRESENT.  THE REGULATING EQUIPMENT WAS DETERMINED TO FUNCTION AS DESIGNED DURING INCREASING AND DECREASING FLOW AND PRESSURE CONDITIONS.  THE REGULATING EQUIPMENT WAS FOUND TO OPERATE PROPERLY WITH THE FLUIDS REMOVED.  IT IS CURRENTLY BELIEVED THAT THE PRESENCE OF PIPELINE FLUIDS AND GAS TEMPERATURE DROP ACROSS THE REGULATORS CAUSED THE REGULATORS TO MALFUNCTION."

FIVE OF THE EVACUEES WERE TAKEN TO AN UNKNOWN AREA HOSPITAL WITH MINOR INJURIES. THE FDNY HAD TURNED OFF 8 GAS METERS IN 3 BUILDINGS (# 3974, 3976 & 3978 WHITE PLAINS ROAD). THE EXPLOSION INVOLVED AN INDUSTRIAL OVEN IN THE BAKERY(# 3978 WHITE PLAINS ROAD) WHICH SUSTAINED SEVERE DAMAGE. THERE WAS NO STRUCTURAL DAMAGE BUT THERE WAS EXTENSIVE INTERIOR, AND SOME EXTERIOR DAMAGE TO THE BAKERY. THE ADJACENT BUILDINGS WERE NOT AFFECTED. GDS CHECKED THE GAS PRESSURE IN THE BAKERY AND FOUND 8.8"" WC WITH NO LOAD. THERE WERE NO NATURAL GAS READINGS INSIDE ANY OF THE CONNECTED BUILDINGS. THE FDNY'S INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE CUSTOMER-OWNED EQUIPMENT (COMMERCIAL OVEN) WAS THE SOURCE OF THE EXPLOSION. THE CUSTOMER HAD TROUBLE WITH THE OVEN ON THURSDAY 12/9/10 AND HAD IT SERVICED THAT DAY. THE OVEN WAS USED WITHOUT PROBLEMS ON FRIDAY 12/10/10 AND SATURDAY 12/11/10.

CURRENTLY SERVICE HAS BEEN RESTORED TO ALL CUSTOMERS.     COLUMBIA'S CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATORS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS FIRE WAS THE RESULT OF A CROSS ARM FAILURE FROM OUR ELECTRICAL PROVIDER'S NEARBY POWER POLE.  THE HIGH VOLTAGE PRIMARY CONDUCTORS (LINES) FELL INTO THE SECONDARY ELECTRICAL DROP SERVING COLUMBIA'S REGULATOR STATION BUILDING AND ENERGIZED THE NEUTRAL TO 7200 VOLTS.  THIS RESULTED IN A FAULT CURRENT THAT TRAVELED VIA ALL AVAILABLE GROUND PATHS TO STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES LOCATED INSIDE THE STATION.  THE SUBSEQUENT ELECTRICAL ARCING RESULTED IN HOLES BEING BURNED IN THE STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES WHICH RELEASED GAS THAT WAS IGNITED BY THE ELECTRICAL ARCING, RESULTING IN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THIS FIRE.      ONCE THE GAS-FED FIRE IGNITED WITHIN THE REGULATOR STATION FROM THE ELECTRICALLY DAMAGED STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES AND CONTROL BOX, THE FIRE FROM THE CONTROL LINES BURNED THE GASKETS OUT OF THE LARGE DIAMETER PIPE FLANGES AND A MUCH LARGER FIRE  ENSUED FED BY THE 130 PSIG GAS.

VERNON) TO THE GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER. GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) RESPONDED AND OBTAINED A 60% GAS-IN-AIR READING AT THE 20' LINE OF #426 E 4 ST. THE LEAK WAS CLASSIFIED TYPE-1 DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO THE 24"" TRANSMISSION MAIN (230 PSI). GAS CONSTRUCTION CREWS AND SUPERVISION RESPONDED, INVESTIGATED AND AT 1536 HRS IT WAS DETERMINED THE LEAK MAY BE COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION MAIN. THE 12"" 1957 STEEL TRANSMISSION INLET TO GAS REGULATOR GR-514 WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK IN THE VICINITY OF A DRIP POT AND RISER. GR-514 WAS VALVED OFF AND THE LEAK EXCAVATED AFTER PRESSURE WAS BLED DOWN. THE EXCAVATION DETERMINED THE ACTUAL SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS ON A 1"" COUPLING IN THE DRIP RISER AT THE INLET PIPING TO GR-514. PRESSURE CONTROL, GAS CONTROL AND GAS ENGINEERING DETERMINED THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY NEGATIVE SYSTEM IMPACT DUE TO THE LOSS OF THIS TRANSMISSION PRESSURE TO HIGH PRESSURE REGULATOR STATION.   TRANSMISSION VALVES 25960 AND 28563 WERE CLOSED AT 1705 HRS AND PRESSURE REDUCTION THROUGH GR-514. THE LEAKING COUPLING WAS REMOVED AND A WELDED CAP INSTALLED ON THE DRIP POT WHERE THE RISER CONNECTS TO THE DRIP POT, REMOVING THE HAZARD. THE REGULATOR STATION REMAINED OFFLINE WHILE ADDITIONAL PLANNED WORK REPLACING 70' OF THE AFFECTED SECTION OF INLET PIPING TO THE REGULATOR STATION WAS COMPLETED. THE PIPELINE WORK WAS COMPLETED, AND THE MAIN RESTORED TO FULL SERVICE ON NOVEMBER 9, 2010 AT 23:01 HRS. THE US DOT AND NYS PSC WERE NOTIFIED.

CENTERVILLE IS LOCATED IN APPANOOSE COUNTY.  CONDITIONS THAT MORNING WERE CLEAR AND SUNNY WITH TEMPERATURES AROUND 65 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.     AT APPROXIMATELY 8:48 AM CST, INTERSTATE POWER & LIGHT'S (IPL) DISTRIBUTION DISPATCH CENTER IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IA RECEIVED A CALL FROM EMPLOYEES IN IPL'S CENTERVILLE CALL CENTER WITH A REPORT OF AN ELECTRICAL OUTAGE AND A HOUSE FIRE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CALL CENTER BUILDING.  AN ELECTRIC LINEMAN WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 9:05 AM, A CALL ALSO CAME IN FROM THE CENTERVILLE POLICE/FIRE DISPATCHER REPORTING A HOUSE FIRE. WHEN THE IPL LINEMAN ARRIVED ONSITE AT 9:20 AM, THE VALVE AT THE GAS METER SET HAD BEEN SHUT OFF BY FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL.  AT THIS POINT, THE SITUATION APPEARED TO BE A HOUSE FIRE CAUSED BY A SQUIRREL MAKING CONTACT WITH AN ENERGIZED SWITCH ON A POLE AT THE REAR OF 1202 DRAKE AVENUE, WHICH RESULTED IN A FAULT AND BREAKER OPERATIONS THAT INTRODUCED HIGH VOLTAGE ELECTRICITY INTO THE HOME'S ELECTRICAL WIRING SYSTEM.       AT APPROXIMATELY 9:25 AM, DURING FIREFIGHTING ACTIVITIES, A ""WHOOSH"" OR ""FLASH"" OCCURRED, INDICATING AN IGNITION OF GAS.  AT THIS POINT, FLAMES ALSO APPEARED ALONG THE GROUND NEAR THE HOUSE.  GAS EMPLOYEES ARRIVED ON SITE AT 9:32 AM.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:25 AM, GAS TO THE RESIDENCE WAS SHUT OFF BY EXCAVATING OVER THE SERVICE TAP AND OPERATING THE EXISTING SERVICE TEE.    SIX FIREFIGHTERS SOUGHT MEDICAL TREATMENT DUE TO THE GAS IGNITION.  THREE OF THEM WERE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR OVERNIGHT OBSERVATION AND RELEASED THE NEXT DAY.     AN IOWA UTILITIES BOARD INVESTIGATOR, ALONG WITH A STATE FIRE INVESTIGATOR, VISITED THE SITE ON THE AFTERNOON OF MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 AND WITNESSED THE EXCAVATION AND REMOVAL OF A SEGMENT OF THE SERVICE LINE.  INITIAL INDICATIONS ARE THAT AN ELECTRICAL ARC BETWEEN THE ELECTRICAL SERVICE LINE CONDUIT AND THE STEEL GAS SERVICE BURNED A HOLE IN BOTH, ALLOWING GAS TO MIGRATE INTO THE ALREADY BURNING STRUCTURE VIA THE CONDUIT AND INTO THE ELECTRIC SERVICE PANEL.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE EXISTING FIRE IN THE STRUCTURE.

THE ABSENCE OF A SERVICE REGULATOR AT THE METER ALLOWED THE HIGHER-PRESSURE PROPANE TO FLOW BACKWARD THROUGH THE METER INTO ASHBURN'S NATURAL GAS FACILITIES.  GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (GPSC) INSPECTORS JOSH LAIRSEY AND ROB PACER WERE NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT AT APPROXIMATELY 1:45PM ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2010.   ASHBURN CITY MANAGER BEN TAYLOR ESTABLISHED A COMMAND CENTER AT CITY HALL TO DEVELOP A PLAN OF ACTION WITH ALL CITY PERSONNEL. DUE TO THE UNKNOWN VOLUME AND EXTENT OF PROPANE IN THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM, CITY PERSONNEL DECIDED TO BEGIN SHUTTING OFF ALL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. MUTUAL ASSISTANCE WAS REQUESTED FROM AND PROVIDED BY THE CITIES OF DOUGLAS, TIFTON, CORDELE, SYLVESTER AND FITZGERALD.  ASHBURN CONFIRMED THAT THESE CITIES' PERSONNEL HAVE APPROPRIATE OPERATOR QUALIFICATIONS TO PERFORM THE REQUESTED TASK. THE SHUT OFF PROCESS BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00PM ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 24TH, 2010.  ACTING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM GPSC TO REPORT THIS EVENT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AS AN INCIDENT PURSUANT TO 49 CFR PART 191, BEN TAYLOR REQUESTED THAT THE SUBSCRIBED REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SERVICE (SRCS) MAKE THE TELEPHONIC REPORT ON BEHALF OF ASHBURN.   ON 9/24/2010 AT 3:16PM, SRCS MANAGER BILL DEFOOR CALLED THE NRC AND GAVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO KEVIN WILLIAMS, WHO ASSIGNED CASE #955047 TO THE REPORT.ON 9/24/2010 AT 6:59PM THE VALVE SUPPLYING NATURAL GAS TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WAS SHUT OFF.  THE SHUTTING OFF AND LOCKING OF ALL SERVICES WAS COMPLETE AT APPROXIMATELY 3:15AM ON 9/25/2010. DURING THE COMPLETION OF THE SHUT-OFF ACTION LINE PRESSURE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM DROPPED TO ZERO AS HAT CREEK CONSUMED THE REMAINING CONTAMINATED GAS THROUGH ITS PEANUT DRYERS. ON 9/25/2010 AT 9:00AM THE VALVE CONTROLLING THE GAS FLOW TO THE CITY WAS CUT BACK ON. AS A PRECAUTION, LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WERE MONITORED FOR 100% GAS USING (CGI) COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATORS. THE LOCATIONS THAT WERE MONITORED WERE INDUSTRIAL BLVD., CENTRAL PACKING PLANT, AND BRIDGES ROAD. WHEN 100% LEVELS WERE CONFIRMED, CREWS BEGAN CUTTING ON SERVICES AND RELIGHTING APPLIANCES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.  THE RELIGHTING PROCESS STARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30AM SATURDAY MORNING. AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00PM A MAJORITY OF THE SERVICES WERE BACK ON.  WHERE OCCUPANTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ALLOW ACCESS FOR RELIGHTING, CONTACT INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS WERE PLACED IN A CONSPICUOUS LOCATION.  A POST-EMERGENCY"

ON THAT DAY AT 17:15, AVISTA WAS NOTIFIED OF A FIRE AT 825 OAK KNOLL DR. IN ASHLAND, OR (JACKSON COUNTY). THIS WAS REPORTED TO DOT BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF GAS COMBINED WITH THE TOTAL COST OF THE INCIDENT BEING IN EXCESS OF $50,000.    AN AVISTA FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SITE AT 17:30 BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET TO THE HOMES DUE TO THE FIRE. A TWO INCH STEEL DISTRIBUTION MAIN WAS SQUEEZED TO SHUT OFF GAS TO THE AREA AT 21:37, THIS SHUT OFF GAS SERVICE TO EIGHT HOMES. GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO FIVE OF THE HOMES BY 12:29 ON SEPTEMBER 3RD, 2010. THE OTHER THREE SERVICES WERE NOT RESTORED BECAUSE THE HOMES AND THEIR METER SETS WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE. NO FURTHER DAMAGE OCCURRED TO OUR SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT.    GAS WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, BUT NOT THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE. THE CAUSE OF THE BLAZE IS BELIEVED TO BE A GRASS FIRE FROM A NEARBY FIELD. PER THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT; 30-40 HOMES WERE EVACUATED, 11 HOMES WERE DESTROYED, NO FATALITIES OR HOSPITALIZATIONS. THE TOTAL COST OF THE INCIDENT IS ESTIMATED AT $4,405,743 (11 HOMES LOST, WORTH APPROX $400,000 EACH + AVISTA COSTS OF $5,743 FROM PART D). THE COST OF THE REPLACEMENT OF THE HOMES IS AN ESTIMATE BECAUSE THIS IS PRIVATE INFORMATION BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE HOMEOWNERS."

JANUARY 2012 SUPPLEMENT:  BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF A THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED SEGMENT OF PIPE, THE CAUSE OF THE TWO-INCH PVC MAIN PIPE LEAK DISCOVERED ON FIRST STREET ON JULY 11, 2010 WAS A PREVIOUS THIRD PARTY'S FAILURE TO EMPLOY PROPER EXCAVATION PRACTICES. SPECIFICALLY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PIPE HAD BEEN UNCOVERED DURING A PREVIOUS EXCAVATION AND THAT THE BACKFILL WAS UNLAWFULLY AND INPROPERLY DUMPED BACK IN THE HOLE WITHOUT COMPACTION. THIS LEFT THE PIPE WITHOUT LATERAL SUPPORT FROM THE DOWNWARD LOADING CAUSED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE NON-COMPACTED BACKFILL, AND FROM OTHER POSSIBLE LOADINGS. THIS LED TO EXCESSIVE LONG-TERM DEFORMATION OF THE PIPE, CAUSING PREMATURE FAILURE."

PG&E CONDUCTED A SPECIAL LEAK SURVEY IN THE AREA ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT AND FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT LEAKS.  TWO 'FUZZ' LEAKS WERE FOUND AT METER SETS IN THE AREA.  AFTER CONDUCTING THE LEAK SURVEY, THE SERVICE LINE TO THE INCIDENT SITE WAS CUT OFF AT THE MAIN AND WAS PRESSURE TESTED AT 100 PSIG FOR 10 MIN BACK TO THE RISER VALVE. THE LINE HELD PRESSURE, INDICATING AN AIR TIGHT SEAL FROM THE MAIN TO THE RISER VALVE.  ACCORDING TO FIRE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATIONS, EVIDENCE SHOWS THE EXPLOSION WAS THE RESULT OF A 'DELIBERATE ACT'.  PG&E HAS REQUESTED A COPY OF THE INVESTIGATION REPORT FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

THE GERC DISPATCHED A GDS MECHANIC AND SUPERVISOR, GAS CONSTRUCTION AND A GAS ERG. GDS RESPONDED AND REPORTED THAT A GAS CONSTRUCTION CREW WAS ON LOCATION WORKING AN EXISTING TYPE 2 LEAK. THE INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE CREW WAS PREPARING TO INSTALL AN EXPANSION STOPPER IN A 2"" STEEL SERVICE TEE ON A 4"" MEDIUM PRESSURE STEEL MAIN WHEN THE GAS IGNITED. TWO GAS CONSTRUCTION MECHANICS WERE TAKEN VIA EMS TO SOUNDSHORE HOSPITAL WHERE THEY WERE TREATED AND RELEASED. MECHANIC A RECEIVED SECOND DEGREE BURNS, WHICH WERE SEVERAL INCHES IN LENGTH TO HIS FOREARMS. MECHANIC B SUSTAINED A SECOND DEGREE BURN, WHICH WAS ALSO SEVERAL INCHES IN LENGTH TO HIS RIGHT FOREARM AND A SMALL FIRST DEGREE BURN NEAR THE BACK OF HIS NECK. THE MECHANICS WERE BOTH BROUGHT TO CON EDISON'S RYE SERVICE CENTER FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING AND BOTH MEHANICS TESTED NEGATIVE. CHANNEL 12 NEWS ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 14:56, THE LEAK WAS TEMPORARILY SECURED AT 15:10 AND THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE. CREWS THEN INSTALLED A MECHANICAL CONTROL FITTING, INSERTED AN EXPANSION STOPPER AND CLOSED ONE MAIN VALVE AT 20:15 TO ISOLATE THE MAIN, INTERRUPTING SERVICE TO FOUR (4) RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. THE SECTION OF MAIN IN THE EXCAVATION WAS REMOVED AND TAKEN TO THE GAS DEVELOPMENT LAB FOR ANALYSIS. THE GAS WAS BACK ON LINE AT 21:50 AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE AFFECTED CUSTOMERS. AN ICS STRUCTURE WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE COMMAND POST WAS LOCATED IN FRONT OF 611 CLAFLIN AVE. THIS WAS AN UPGRADED LEVEL INCIDENT."

ONCE THE SUBCONTRACTOR HAD ENTERED, A FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE IN THE MANHOLE IGNITED AND BURNED THE SUBCONTRACTOR, REQUIRING MEDICAL TREATMENT.  THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT NATURAL GAS MAY HAVE MIGRATED FROM AN NEARBY LEAK AND POSSIBLY COLLECTED IN THE MANHOLE.  THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN IN THE VICINITY OF THE MANHOLE WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A LAB FOR TESTING AND INSPECTION.   THE TESTS DISCOVERED A CRACK IN THE PIPE APPROXIMATELY A HALF-BLOCK AWAY FROM THE MANHOLE.  THE CRACK WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE EXTERNAL LOADING FROM PASSING VEHICLES.  WHILE THE TYPE OF FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED, IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY LEAKING NATURAL GAS FROM THE CRACK IN THE PIPE THAT HAD MIGRATED TO AND COLLECTED IN THE AT&T MANHOLE.      ."

UPON ARRIVAL, THE HOME LOCATED AT 415 SOUTH 100 EAST WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, AND NATURAL GAS WAS ESCAPING NEAR THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOME FROM WHERE THE GAS METER ONCE WAS.    THE FORCE OF THE HOME EXPLODING CAUSED THE METER TO BE SEVERED FROM THE SERVICE LINE AND CAUSED THE UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS.  THE GAS DID NOT IGNITE OR EXPLODE.  THE METER WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY TEN FEET FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOME.  THE 3/4 INCH NIPPLE GOING INTO THE REGULATOR HAD FAILED DUE TO THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION.    IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVAL QUESTAR PERSONNEL PERFORMED TESTS TO CHECK FOR GAS IN THE GROUND AROUND THE DAMAGED HOUSE AND IN THE SEWER MANHOLES.  NO GAS WAS DETECTED IN THE GROUND, IN THE TELEPHONE DUCT WORK OR IN THE SEWER.      QUESTAR PERSONNEL THEN BEGAN TO SECURE THE SITE AND CUT AND CAPPED THE DAMAGE SERVICE LINE.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS LEAK TESTED FROM THE CUT TO THE RISER.  NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.  THE REMAINDER OF THE SERVICE LINE WAS LEAK TESTED FROM THE CUT TO THE MAIN AND THEN PERMANENTLY RETIRED.  NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.    ONCE THE DAMAGED SERVICE LINE WAS SECURED ADDITIONAL LEAK SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE AREA TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS NO LEAKING GAS IN THE GENERAL VICINITY.  THE ADDITIONAL LEAK SURVEY INCLUDED ALL SURFACE STREETS, DUCTS, SEWERS, AND GAS LINE LOCATIONS WITHIN A TWO BLOCK LIMIT OF THE DAMAGED HOME.  NO LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED.

THE GAS SERVICE LINE WAS SHUT-OFF AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30PM. A LEAK SURVEY OF THE MAIN LINES AND SERVICE LINES ON W. 83RD BETWEEN MADISON AND LORAIN REVEALED NO INDICATIONS OF GAS NEAR THE STRUCTURE. A SERVICE LEAK AT 2131 WEST 83RD STREET WAS DETECTED DURING THE LEAK SURVEY. THIS SERVICE LINE WAS REPLACED UPON DISCOVERY.     ON TUESDAY, JANUARY 26TH, 2010 THE SERVICE LINE AT 2022 W. 83RD WAS AIR TESTED AT OPERATING PRESSURE WITH NO PRESSURE LOSS. AN ODOR TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT 2028 WAST 83RD STREET. THE RESULTS OF THIS ODOR TEST REVEALED ODOR LEVELS WELL WITHIN DOT COMPLIANCE LEVELS. OUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED AN ODOR COMPLAINT AT THIS RESIDENCE ON JANUARY 18TH. DOMINION PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE CALL AND MET WITH THE CLEVELAND FIRE DEPARTMENT. DOMINION FOUND THE METER DISCONNECTED AND THE METER SHUT-OFF VALVE IN THE HALF OPEN POSITION. THE SHUT-OFF VALVE WAS CLOSED BY THE DOMINION TECHNICIAN AND SECURED WITH A LOCKING DEVICE. THE TECHNICIAN PLACED A 3/4 INCH PLUG IN THE OPEN END OF THE VALVE. THE TECHNICIAN ALSO ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE THE CURB-SLOP VALVE, BUT COULD NOT. THE SERVICE LINE WAS THEN BAR HOLE TESTED UTILIZING A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR FROM THE STREET TO THE STRUCTURE.  AS A RESULT.  NO LEAKAGE WAS DISCOVERED. A SECOND ATTEMPT TO CTOSE THE CURB BOX  VALVE ON JANUARY 19TH ENDED WHEN BLOCKAGE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE VALVE BOX. THE VALVE BOX WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SCHEDULED FOR EXCEVATLON AND SHUT OFF BY A CONSTRUCTION CREW AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  AN INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT SITE DETERMINED THE CAUSE TO BE ARSON AS APPROXIMATELY 6 INCHES OF SERVICE LINE AND THE METER SHUT-OFF VALVE (WITH LOCKING DEVICE STILL INTACT), DETACHED FROM THE SERVICE LINE, WERE RECOVERED INSIDE THE STRUCTURE."
